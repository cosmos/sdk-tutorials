## Blockchain & game theory

Blockchains depend on achieving distributed consensus. Thus, the technology's success is based on **incentivising** of protocol beneficial behaviour. Actions that could lead to the destruction of a protocol or have a negative impact on the functioning, security, or application have to be deterred. For this reason, accurate and effective incentive structures are of vital significance.

Just imagine what could happen if one can gain economically more by verifying blocks that are not actually valid.

The importance of game theory for blockchain protocols is clear when understanding that a blockchain constitutes a network of interdependent, anonymous, and decentralised nodes. In addition, as cryptocurrencies are linked to blockchain protocols, the importance for blockchain protocols in general also transcends in relation to cryptocurrencies.

Game theory has provided blockchain technology with a number of postulations in regard to human decision-making and motivation, as well as possibilities to set "right" incentives. It is used as **a tool to enforce wished outcomes while operating without a central authority**.

The game theoretical fundament becomes especially visible when taking a look at the term **cryptoeconomics**.

Cryptoeconomics are seen as the *combination of cryptography and economics*. Economic insights are used to create structures within distributed systems that make node behaviour to a certain degree predictable and with it ensure distributed networking. Cryptography fulfils its role by providing the means to authenticate messages, create the immutable chain, secure addresses, etc. One could say, cryptography ensures backward-looking security and economics forward-looking security through incentives.

Game theoretical scenarios can be applied to situations in distributed computing. The consensus system in place for example can be viewed as a mean to protect blockchain protocols from coordination problems, grim trigger equilibria, and bounded rationality. We can therefore expect that more complex and dynamic game theoretical work will be incorporated and fostered as blockchain protocols do.

# Introduction: The Crypto Economy

One of the concepts often discussed in the context of blockchain technology is the so-called global **crypto economy**. 
The spectrum, in which this concept is discussed, is fairly wide. It ranges from the fundamentalist free market advocate corner to large corporations trying to anticipate and capture emerging applications.

It is important to note that the term crypto economy is merely used to describe new and sometimes different business models. It is still just economics, the same rules apply, and it can be assessed with traditional analytic models. The only difference is the **scope and access of the underlying infrastructure**.

In the following we are going to frame the concept of crypto economy and then discuss it by presenting **two types of crypto economy business models**:

* **Internal Business Models**: A pure crypto economy is where all activity happens **within one blockchain network**. The blockchain network is not used to track or react to things happening outside of the network;
* **Mixed Business Models**: Mixed approaches combine activity happening outside the blockchain network with activity or tracking within it.

![Crypto Economy](images/crypto-economy-no-glass-01.png)

The blockchain network and processes **within** can be seen as belonging to the **internal sphere**, whereas the realm **outside** of a blockchain can be seen as being part of the **external sphere**. 
**Internal business models** refer to activities **within** a blockchain. 
**Mixed business models** include activities, which touch upon the realm **within** a blockchain and **outside** of it.

Most new blockchain-associated business models can be counted into the mixed category. 
These are much more common and can be expected to continue being more popular than internal blockchain business models. 
Why is this?
Most business activities have relied on external data and will have to maintain doing so. 
Furthermore, in many cases it is probably more cost-efficient to employ mixed business models. 
Existing parts of business operations could be substituted with blockchain-based solutions in cases where they are more efficient and those parts, which would not benefit much from a blockchain-based solution and/or are not well-suited for an implementation on a blockchain, could be kept on the external realm. 
Thus, mixed business models will probably be more implemented than internal business models.



### Raising capital: Initial Public Coin Offering (ICO/IPCO)

In capital structure theory, one often differentiates between **internal and external financing**. 
Whereas, **internal** refers to situation in which a company uses profits as source of capital by re-investing them instead of distributing profits among the owners and/or investors (**reinvesting profits**) or **provisions are liquidated**. 
**External** describes a situation in which financing of new investments and firm activities is done through external financial means. 
External financing methods are equity issues, such as IPOs and credit financing.

![Traditional Financing Possibilities](images/Traditionalraisingcapital.png)

Currently the most interesting aspect of how blockchain technology impacts finance activities is the new form of raising external capital...

Blockchain technology bears the potential of creating means to raise capital detached from "traditional" ways of external financing. 
Furthermore, **crowdfunding** is to date one of the few actually proved use cases of blockchain technology. 
Combined with smart contract automation also the potential for implementation in regard to **Initial Coin Offering (ICO)** campaigns is very high.

The **Initial Public Coin Offering (IPCO)** has become a very popular method for crypto projects to raise capital, although there is no reason why traditional businesses should not be able to use the same mechanisms to raise funding.

ICOs usually involve investors buying either **tokens** or the promise of future tokens once a project is implemented. 
These tokens are usually trade-able after the project is launched, sometimes even before, and are usually used to finance the project. 
Investors buy these tokens in the hope that they gain value as they are being adopted in the future.

There are two common ways that tokens have been **issued** in the past for ICOs:

* Either tokens are promised **as part of the initial distribution of a cryptocurrency** in a blockchain network, for example as was with Ethereum, DECENT, BitShares, Factom, and many more; or
* Smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain are used in projects to **issue tokens for later future activities**, as for example in the case of Augur and SingularDTV.

Because of their similarity to stock offerings many projects execute their ICOs as software pre-sales, e.g. Ethereum and DECENT. 
As of now, the legal dimension of ICOs is uncertain and the practice of token offerings has been debated and criticised.



## Cryptocurrencies as a business model

In the wake of Bitcoin's success many other cryptocurrency networks were launched. 
A number of them were scams, some were well-meant failures. 
Despite the odds many have survived -as a quick look at [Coinmarketcap's list](http://coinmarketcap.com/) proves.

These so-called **altcoins** are worth investigating for two key reasons. 
First, they provide an outlet for innovation in a technological field otherwise refused by stakeholders of other currencies. 
Second, they give us interesting case studies to understand how the crypto economy and the rest of the world interact with each other, where the crypto economy can work, and where it is bound to fail.

Because these systems are easy to operate but hard to regulate, they also provide a hotbed for scams and frauds.

Moreover, altcoins also follow **regular economic patterns**. 
For example, any new launched cryptocurrency network must differentiate itself from other systems to be able to attract users and be profitable. 
Attracting users is essential to increase network effects -the value of the good and/or service increases with raising usage (i.e. user numbers). 
Altcoins are network goods and thus rely on increasing user numbers to be attractive for new potential users and establish their market dominance.

A prime example of cryptocurrencies as a business model is the [launch of **Litecoin**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litecoin#History) in 2011. 
It resulted mainly because the creator disagreed with certain technical aspects of Bitcoin.

Furthermore, there have been several attempts to tie cryptocurrencies to external business activities. 
For example [**Scotcoin**](http://scotcoin.org/) attempted to anchor itself to a geographical region. 
There are other examples, but most of them have not been particularly successful.

For what reason could that be?

It is very **difficult to link** things that are happening within a blockchain network to activities and events happening outside of it without using **trusted authorities**. 
When a trusted authority is included in the design, the selection and inclusion of such authorities as well as other aspects related to their role and function would have to be incorporated in the network design.

<div class="b9-expandable-box">
	<div class="b9-expandable-title">
		Just imagine!
	</div>
	<div class="b9-expandable-text">
		<p>In case the Scottish government was to adopt Scotcoin as the official digital currency of Scotland, their trusted authority would have to influence the state of the blockchain network. Currently traditional currencies are issued by central banks. These hold the monopoly right to issue currencies in their area of circulation, mostly the respective country. With it, central banks regulate production and issuance of currencies. The regulation of the monetary base is called monetary policy. Central bank's monetary policy is strongly interrelated to fiscal policy, which lies in the hands of national governments and especially the Ministry of Finance. Scotcoin would require including the Scottish government and their respective central bank into the implementation of the cryptocurrency, while also possibly needing to integrating possibilities to implement monetary and fiscal policy.</p>

# Introduction: A New World - Cryptocurrencies

In our modern economy, mechanisms, transfers, and business models cover a wide range geographically and also conceptually. Just remember the typology presented in the *Introduction into Economic Theory*.

The way an economy acts is strongly linked to existing and possible fiscal and monetary policy.

<div class="b9-info">
	<p>Just to clarify, <b>monetary policy</b> means all political decisions and regulations targeted at governing money supply, i.e. to create a well-equilibrated demand and supply of money. Whereas, <b>fiscal policy</b> refers to decisions and regulations in the area of financial governance, i.e. to create a system of well-equilibrated revenues (taxes) and expenditures (spending).</p>
</div>

The appearance of cryptocurrencies can have an immense disruptive potential of fiscal and especially monetary policies of governments.

Before the introduction of blockchain technology, one could already see an example in which a currency was still centralised but was transferred from the national to supranational level, the **Euro**. This currency seemed like an insanity before it was implemented and now has become a comfortable convenience in the Euro Zone.

Our current economic systems can be mostly analysed depending by **scope**, i.e. domestic and international, and/or **sector**, i.e. manufacturing, agriculture, services, etc.

Just imagine: If one takes a look at exports by product groups, one can see that the biggest group of merchandise exports are manufacturing products. How might these change with a stronger and wider crypto economy and cryptocurrency system developing?

![Merchandise exports](images/merchandise-export.png)

This question cannot be answered with 100% assurance, but one can definitely say that interesting times are probably awaiting us.

## About this Module

In our quest through the world of cryptocurrencies, we are aiming at answering the following questions:

* What is a cryptocurrency?
* What makes a cryptocurrency different from fiat money and other previously existing currency systems?
* What are related services that have come up with the emergence of cryptocurrencies?
* What are economic activities surrounding cryptocurrencies?
* How might the adoption of cryptocurrencies be fostered/curtailed?

We will start with the fundamentals surrounding cryptocurrencies to then move along towards business models related to cryptocurrencies, with a focus on related services. Afterwards, we will take a look at potential of cryptocurrencies and potential barriers for adoption. We will conclude this module with a broad overview on some indicators of the most-known cryptocurrency, Bitcoin.

Enjoy!

The magnitude with which the crypto-economy is evolving has made it almost impossible to keep up. In addition, with a large number of tokens worth millions of USD being traded daily, it is inevitable that many people question the security and incentives of each of these coins. -> https://blockchainatberkeley.blog/understanding-crypto-economic-security-through-game-theory-526e810c7736 -->


# Cryptocurrency Fundamentals

In this section, we will take a look at some fundamental concepts that will help in better understand cryptocurrencies, their (dis-)advantages, the concepts and terms surrounding them, and the economic phenomenon that come with them.

But before beginning, let us first take a look at how the term **cryptocurrency** can be defined.

The term cryptocurrency is strongly linked to the upcoming of blockchains. A cryptocurrency is a combination of two concepts, cryptography and currency. Cryptocurrencies are tokens, i.e. coins, that are ruled by the cryptographic algorithm governing a decentralised system. They are trusted due to the underlying cryptography of a blockchain protocol. It is thus:

*a digital asset, which functions as a medium of value exchange, bound to the cryptographic protocol of a decentralised network, and its programmed rules.*

Taking this definition at hand, a cryptocurrency is a **crypto-asset**, i.e. an asset depending on cryptography and distributed ledger technology.

Crypto-assets have developed into an area highly financed, as of the end of 2018, the market capitalisation of crypto-assets amounts to approximately 110 billion Euro. It had peaked in January 2018 to 700 billion Euro (as determined by [Coinmarket](https://coinmarketcap.com/all/views/all/)).

## Money

To be able to better understand cryptocurrencies and the revolution they represent, it is sound to first take a look at money, what it is, and how it has developed over time as a concept maintaining certain characteristics but also changing others.

Let us start with a simple and general definition about money.

**Money** can be defined as *a method to transfer value*. As such, it serves as a mean to purchase/acquire services and goods.

When taking this general understanding as starting point, one can see that many materials have been used as money for a long time.

When humanity started settling down and focusing on producing goods and services, as well as consuming them, trade erupted. With trade, the need for a mean to exchange value became necessary.

As early as 10,000 BC the trade of goods began. Around 2,000 BC metals were used as a mean representing value, i.e. the first forms of "money". With time, gold and silver became more common as a mean around the world, and with it the concept of currency started crystallising.

## The concept of currency

**Currency** as *money in circulation as a mean of exchange* mainly fulfils 3 functions to be considered as such:

* **store of value**,
* **method of transfer**, and
* **unit of account**.

As a **store of value**, a currency is able to maintain value that can be then traded for other assets of value (**method of transfer**), and at the same time be measured and compared (**unit of account**).

### Gold as a currency

The most old and commonly known currency is **gold**.

Why is gold considered a currency?

Taking a look at the functions a currency has to fulfil, one can say gold is a good store of value. This is so, because it is a rare material that cannot be reproduced - even though alchemist pursuit in chrysopoeia the transformation of basic metals like lead into noble metals such as gold. In addition, it does not perish and can only be consumed as part of jewellery. This attributes make gold a very good **store of value** compared to materials like salt, cocoa, etc. that were also used as currencies for trade.

Moreover, gold is easy to transport as it has a high density and occupies little space. This makes it a good **method of transfer**. Merchants could take it with them on their travels to purchase other goods of interest.

Furthermore, as gold is fungible, i.e. the same amount of gold is equal to another one, it is a good **unit of account**. Each unit of gold, whether it is an ounce, a bar, or a coin, has the same value because its characteristics are the same. This differentiates gold from other means of value like diamonds.

Around **2,000 BC to 1,500 AD** gold maintained its predominant position as currency. It was seen as reliable and better suited than many other materials, but at the same time gold also brought some disadvantages.

First, the more gold became accepted as currency, as with many other materials of value, the more fraudulent behaviour started arising. Among others, the mixing of gold with other cheaper materials was used to create falsifications that were difficult to always differentiate from 100% gold. In the end, gold was not the best store of value.

Second, as it was quite heavy it was not so easily transported in large quantities.

Third, it was easier divisible than many other materials used as currencies. Still its divisibility might not be a complicated and sophisticated process, but remains challenging in a normal store.

## A new era: Paper money

As a reaction new systems were introduced. The one remaining until nowadays is **paper money**. It is often called fiat money.

<div class="b9-expandable-box">
	<div class="b9-expandable-title">
		Fiat Money
	</div>
	<div class="b9-expandable-text">
		<p>What is fiat money?</p>
		<p>The term fiat comes from Latin. It can be translated as <i>"let it be done"</i>. It was used for the term as in Latin <i>fiat</i> was understood as in the context of a decree or resolution - Fiat money can be conceptualised as a government-issued currency.</p>
		<p>Fiat money is per definition a currency that does not hold an intrinsic value, i.e. it does not have a "use value". Thus, its value depends on a government, or other central authority, ascribing it value and maintaining it, and it also derives value as soon as it is used as a mean of exchange.</p>
		<p>It is an alternative to <b>commodity money</b>, which is created from a good, i.e. material, and can be used for more than just the purposes of a currency.</p>
		<p>Similar to fiat money is <b>representative money</b>. Representative money has an inherent similar underlying rationale, but it is used as a unit for a claim on a commodity.</p>
		<p>The first use of paper money was recorded in China during the Yuan and Ming dynasties (11th century).</p>
	</div>
</div>

One can observe a shift from a **decentralised system**, when currencies used to be gold, to a **strongly centralised system**, when currencies became fiat money and thus the access and supply of currencies was regulated through a central authority.

How did the systems based on paper money work?

Imagine, you are a merchant and have brought gold and silver from your travels. Now, you want to store the value represented by this metals in a more transportable unit of account.

So, you go to the next bank. Here a so-called *"I owe you"* (IOU) is issued by the bank. This IOU is nothing more than a paper-document stating the amount the bank owes you.

You are now able to use the IOUs as currency - exchange it for other goods or just use it as a mean to store value.

The benefit of using paper money, i.e. IOUs, is that it is a much better store of value than gold, especially when pegged to gold, as the metal is rare. Furthermore, it is very light and thus easy to transfer. Also, it is a paper that is divisible, but as it represents an abstract representation of value, one has the option to create smaller units.

Money was pegged, i.e. linked, to gold to assure its value. For this reason, there was a storage full of valuable materials and goods to back-up currencies. This pegging of a currency to gold is called the **"gold standard"**.

<div class="b9-expandable-box">
	<div class="b9-expandable-title">
		The Gold Standard
	</div>
	<div class="b9-expandable-text">
		<p>The <b>gold standard</b> was a monetary system. In it the economic unit, such as for example one unit of the currency, is based on a fixed quantity of gold.</p>
		<p>The monetary unit can be either:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>linked to the value of circulating gold coins,</li>
		<li>linked to gold bullions with fixed exchange rates for the currency, or</li>
		<li>linked to a government-guaranteed fixed exchange rate to another currency based on the gold standard.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The gold standard allowed the value of monetary means, i.e. means of exchange, be fixed by an external value independent of its inherent value.</p>
	</div>
</div>

The gold standard became the global standard around 1870. With World War I, the trade from currency to gold requirement was suspended. Afterwards, at a conference in Geneva in 1922 governments acknowledged the use of foreign currencies as reserve.

Following the rocky years of worldwide economic crisis, 44 states decided to establish the so-called Bretton Woods system, which opted to combine the gold standard and flexible exchange rate systems. This system remained in place until 1970s.

<div class="b9-expandable-box">
	<div class="b9-expandable-title">
		The Bretton Woods System
	</div>
	<div class="b9-expandable-text">
		<p>The Bretton Woods system was established to govern and regulate commercial and financial relation between the US, Western Europe, Canada, Australia, and Japan after the World War II.</p>
		<p>The Bretton Woods system dictated that participating countries were required to follow monetary policies maintaining external exchange rates within 1%. Thus, currencies were pegged to gold. By it the International Monetary Fund (IMF), formed in 1945, could bridge imbalances of payment in a short-term, and with it assist the development and stability of economies.</p>
	</div>
</div>

After 450 years, most countries dropped the gold standard again. This was achieved by governments disconnecting their money supply from gold. In 1971, the United States dropped out of the gold standard and ending the Bretton Woods system. This action is often referred to as **Nixon shock**. As a consequence, the US Dollar became the reserve currency for many other currencies, i.e. other states pegged their currency to the Dollar. Thus, they ensured the currency through the value of the US Dollar. This made the Dollar "the" currency for foreign trade, as well as the global reserve currency.

Most of the currencies changed to become "free floating" currencies after the *Smithsonian Agreement* (1973).

<div class="b9-expandable-box">
	<div class="b9-expandable-title">
		Free Floating Currencies
	</div>
	<div class="b9-expandable-text">
		<p>Monetary exchange rates can be either fixed or floating.</p>
		<p>A fixed exchange rate, also called pegged exchange rate, is a regime with a fixed currency value. The value is linked, i.e. pegged, to another currency or to a mean of value like gold.</p>
		<p>In a floating exchange rate, often also named flexible, the regime is constructed so that the currency's value is not fixed. A currency's value is the result of <b>fluctuations on foreign exchange markets</b>.</p>
		<p>One can say: Floating currencies derive their value from market mechanisms. - Remember demand and supply? The same mechanisms apply to floating currencies.</p>
	</div>
</div>

The benefit of floating currencies was that it allowed governments a flexible and more adaptable managing of inflation through money supply, i.e. the amount of money in circulation. With it, money transformed to a commodity of the central banks. The value of money, i.e. a currency, depended now on the willingness of consumers, like local banks, merchants, businesses, etc., to buy and sell it at certain value points. So to say, the worth of a currency depended on the currency's value in foreign market trading and the trust of domestic markets. Thus, money became fiat money as pegging was discontinued in monetary policy.

Trust in a currency shifted from rooting in a trust in the value of gold to trusting the central authority issuing the currency.

## The modern monetary system & the introduction of digital money

How well suited is fiat money as a currency?

Fiat money fulfils **all functions** required from a currency. It is light and easy to transport, while also easy to count and audit. At the same time, it is rare because production is regulated by authorities, i.e. you cannot just print it. Because central authorities can indeed print as much money as they want, they can influence inflation rates, and with it the money supply and value. High inflation rates make currencies less suited as a store of value - the more money is printed, the lower its value (following the demand and supply mechanisms presented previously).

Now, let us turn to our **monetary system**.

Every monetary system must fulfil 3 functions:

* access to money,
* possibility to send and receive money, and
* supply money.

This functions have until recently been the main task area of centralised authorities, mainly central banks and entities dealing with monetary as well as fiscal policies.

The trust in a currency is strongly linked to the degree of trust in the central authorities.

Think back to the Euro crisis. What exactly made the Euro Zone crumbled in distress? Was it really all just about Greece's deficit? When you take into consideration that trust in a currency means trust in central authorities, could it not have been that missing trust was a driver of the crisis?

If our monetary system depends so strongly in trusting central authorities: What happens when many people start distrusting central banks and governments?

A development, which is highly important for our current monetary system, is **digital money**. The digitalisation of money has many advantages but can also be problematic.

As computer systems emerged and continuously improved, digital ledger keeping and accounting was introduced. Most of our current monetary system is ruled by "digital money".

The storage cost and transport is much easier with digital money compared to only paper money. In addition, splitting it is very simple, which makes it a good unit of account. Furthermore, it is very fast to process transactions and also audit. The exchange of currencies can be undertaken completely on a technical level.

A general problem of digital money remains: **Multiplication**. Digital money is only as tamper-proof as the system that is used to keep track of it. It can be easily multiplicated. For this reason, governments have opted to further centralise money limiting the decision on eligibility for account opening, access, balances, and transferring, to central and local banks.

Efforts to decentralise digital money again suffered from a decentralised system currency being a not-suitable store of value, while being a good method of transfer and unit of account. But how to regulate the governance of money supply, access, and transferring remains in a decentralised system.

Here is where cryptocurrencies come in handy.

## Cryptocurrencies: The future?

Remember that cryptocurrency is the term used for *a digital asset, which functions as a medium of value exchange, bound to the cryptographic protocol of a decentralised network, and its programmed rules*.

As such they are always tied to a blockchain.

Cryptocurrencies can be created through mining, but also be pre-mined. When currencies are mined the protocol is designed to create incentives for participants to invest in creating new coins, while at the same time these activities help stabilise and secure the network. Coins can also be pre-mined. This means that they are created before a cryptocurrency starts.

<!-- Include halving, book, p. 70 in future iteration -->

<div class="b9-warning">
	<p>On a general note, pre-mined cryptocurrencies that are not part of a public and open-source blockchain can be part of fraudulent behaviour, like for example a scam. This does not mean that all pre-mined coins have to be linked to a public blockchain. But this indicator can be used to alert us to take a closer and more detailed look before engaging in a currency.</p>
	<p>Another important indicator of something fuzzy happening is the degree of influence a currency creator has on the market. If the creator of a pre-mined currency is able to manipulate the market, one should be very careful with the cryptocurrency.</p>
</div>

There of course also exist hybrid models, in which a certain amount of pre-mined coins is created and then the mining of coins is also implemented afterwards.

### Altcoins

When dealing with cryptocurrencies a common term used is **altcoin**.

What is meant by this?

An altcoin is a cryptocurrency that is not bitcoin. The term is derived from "alternative coins".

As new blockchains appeared in the environment with new protocols, new cryptocurrencies arose.

<div class="b9-tip">
	<p>For an overview of cryptocurrencies, we can always recommend taking a look at <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/">coinmarketcap</a>. The list is not exclusive but includes a lot of the most common currencies.</p>
</div> 

### ERC20 tokens

Another important term to know, are **ERC20 tokens**.

What does this strange term really mean?

With the advancements of blockchain technology, the upcoming of more and more protocols and coins, the question remains: Do we need a blockchain for each cryptocurrency? Will this not lead to an immense number of protocols?

The possibility exists of creating a cryptocurrency, which is not created on its own blockchain but by a smart contract on Ethereum. These tokens are called **Ethereum Request for Comments Number 20 (ERC20)**.

ERC20 have to fulfil six functions:

* the total token amount,
* the individual token amount,
* the origin of transfers,
* the transfer recipient,
* the approval of transfers, and
* the possibility of features.

This type of cryptocurrencies rely heavily on the functioning infrastructure of Ethereum.

Tokens of this type are for example [Augur's reputation token REP](https://www.augur.net/) and [TenX PAY token](https://tenx.tech/de/pay-token/).

### Deflationary currencies: Should we cap a cryptocurrency?

Whether the total supply of a cryptocurrency is capped from the beginning or is open, depends on the protocol.

The total supply can be capped, as it is in the case of Ethereum Classic with a cap at approximately 210million ETC, or remain uncapped.

When one limits the amount of a currency it is called capped.

Capping a currency often leads experts to talk about **"deflationary currencies"**. They are seen as deflationary because the amount of currency circulating usually is expected to decrease, for example due to users loosing or forgetting their private keys. This deflation is by some seen as a huge advantage, but others argue it is to be considered a negative characteristic of certain cryptocurrencies.

Independently, of which corner you take on the deflation debate, one can expect that the value of a capped currency will increase as it is used.

To counteract deflation fixed annual inflation rates of the total supply or inflation rates decided democratically by participants have been discussed for cryptocurrencies. The above described effect is believed to be stronger for coins with constant inflation systems.

### ICOs

In capital structure theory, one often differentiates between **internal and external financing**. 
Whereas, **internal** refers to situation in which a company uses profits as source of capital by re-investing them instead of distributing profits among the owners and/or investors (**reinvesting profits**) or **provisions are liquidated**. 
**External** describes a situation in which financing of new investments and firm activities is done through external financial means. 
External financing methods are equity issues, such as IPOs and credit financing.

Currently the most interesting aspect of how blockchain technology impacts finance activities is the new form of raising external capital...

Blockchain technology bears the potential of creating means to raise capital detached from "traditional" ways of external financing. 
Furthermore, **crowdfunding** is to date one of the few actually proved use cases of blockchain technology. 
Combined with smart contract automation also the potential for implementation in regard to **Initial Coin Offering (ICO)** campaigns is very high.

The **Initial Public Coin Offering (IPCO)** has become a very popular method for crypto projects to raise capital, although there is no reason why traditional businesses should not be able to use the same mechanisms to raise funding.

ICOs usually involve investors buying either **tokens** or the promise of future tokens once a project is implemented. 
These tokens are usually trade-able after the project is launched, sometimes even before, and are usually used to finance the project. 
Investors buy these tokens in the hope that they gain value as they are being adopted in the future.

There are two common ways that tokens have been **issued** in the past for ICOs:

* Either tokens are promised **as part of the initial distribution of a cryptocurrency** in a blockchain network, for example as was with Ethereum, DECENT, BitShares, Factom, and many more; or
* Smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain are used in projects to **issue tokens for later future activities**, as for example in the case of Augur and SingularDTV.

Because of their similarity to stock offerings many projects execute their ICOs as software pre-sales, e.g. Ethereum and DECENT. 
As of now, the legal dimension of ICOs is uncertain and the practice of token offerings has been debated and criticised.

# The Potential of Cryptocurrencies & Barriers for Adoption

After reading about cryptocurrencies and wrapping our head around ICOs, cloud mining, and so many other things related to cryptocurrencies, we now turn to the potential and barriers facing adoption.

So, what is there more to say than: Let us recap and dream!

## Unimagined potentials?

As we have discussed currencies have to fulfil three functions; They have to be a store of value, a unit of account, and method of transfer.

Are cryptocurrencies a better currency compared to fiat money?

Fiat money is a good unit of account. When compared to digital money, cryptocurrencies are an even better unit of account as the ledger on which their transfers are recorded on is immutable. Cryptocurrencies are also more fitting as a method of transfer. Cryptocurrencies can be transferred in almost real-time, while also having low transaction and storage cost. In addition, the function well as a store of value. But here fiat money might be better fitted. The value of cryptocurrencies is often highly volatile. This makes them not so well suited as a store of value.

At the same time, cryptocurrencies have not yet seen potential.

Not only are transactions recorded on an **immutable ledger**, but furthermore represent a potential **decentralised financial system** with open access - this only applies in public blockchains. This more democratic possibility for financial transactions has been positively embraced by especially does disappointed by the events related to the economic and financial crisis. **Trust** in traditional, centralised institutions was shaken and cryptocurrencies represent a new payment system.

Moreover, ICOs have been compared to **capital ventures and other forms of equity**. When drawing a comparison, one can argue that ICOs could allow alternative funding mechanisms especially attractive for start-ups and entrepreneurial business ventures. These type of businesses usually have a high cost to raise capital.

Furthermore, ICOs could provide a real investment opportunity for those investors that do not poses sufficient funds to be considered in a fund.

In addition, **tokenisation**, i.e. the including of asset rights (stocks, gold, bonds, real estate) onto a blockchain, is argued to possibly become an opportunity to conduct traditional investment forms in a faster and more cost-efficient manner. It can also further help with decreasing the need for intermediaries and could increase liquidity of assets due to an improved transfer.

The potential of cryptocurrencies always has to be seen in a differentiated manner. Thus, keeping in mind (possible) negative implications, as well as barriers that hinder cryptocurrency adoption.

## Barriers of Cryptocurrency Adoption

There are a number of factors that can hinder the adoption of cryptocurrencies. In the following, we will take a look at some of them.

First and foremost, the adoption, i.e. use, of cryptocurrencies is strongly related to the degree they are entrusted as currencies. As mentioned above, **trust** is derived from the rules and postulations of the underlying blockchain protocol. As cryptocurrencies are the result of decentralised networks, they cannot rely on trust mechanisms observed in central authorities.

Moreover, trust can also be diminished by the **insecurity** perceived with cryptocurrencies. The accounts of ICO scams, the missing regulatory framework, the not-relying on central authorities, and the sheer amount of cryptocurrencies on the market make them difficult to assess. Thus, users could be discouraged to use cryptocurrencies.

ICOs and tokenisation are also often viewed as risky, as legislation is still developing and regulation is not that far developed. A missing regulatory framework and standard setting increase insecurity for consumers as there is no framework of rules protecting consumers and demanding certain requirements from issuers.

Furthermore, the vast amount of currencies does not only make it difficult to maintain an overview but also **decide** for the right cryptocurrency. Especially in an ICO setting, investors are speculating for positive returns. These are not guaranteed. Risk-averse investors could be reluctant to invest in a cryptocurrency because of the high degree of uncertainty. In addition, the high volatility of currencies can further discourage investment and use of cryptocurrencies.

**Volatility** is used as a mean to numerically express how far win rates are probabilistically close to the mean average. So to say, it is the measure used to indicate the deviation of returns from the expected mean.

![Volatility](images/volatility.png)

It is often used as an indicator for securities and market indexes, but also other assets with a value bound to market mechanisms.

The volatility of cryptocurrency trading in market places is quite high. This means that currencies' market value probabilistically deviate strongly from the mean average.

Also, high volatility is an indicator for a risky investment.

High volatility can thus have the effect that investors do not want to engage.

Another result of high volatility is that cryptocurrencies are not well-suited as a **method of payment**.

Why is this?

If the value of a currency changes quickly, do you really want to use it to pay for goods and services. Imagine you use 1 bitcoin to pay for a sandwich with a value of 3 dollars. The next day you check the market value of the same currency and it has doubled. Would you not be angry at having spent the coin at a 1:3 rate instead of waiting for the next day?

High volatility is therefore dysfunctional to cryptocurrencies establishing as regular and wide payment mean.

Concluding, there are a number of barriers, but also great possible potentials ahead of us. The adoption of cryptocurrencies depends largely on consumers feeling comfortable using cryptocurrencies and trusting in them. In addition, adoption will also depend on how the cryptocurrency environment develops: Will a handful of currencies become dominant? Will volatility fall with decreasing speculation ones the dust settles?...
