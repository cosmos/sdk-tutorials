<h1 class="mt-4 mb-6">Introduction to Blockchain</h1>

This chapter is a general introduction to the concept of blockchain. It is not very technical and reiterates concepts that you might already know. Existing terminology and technologies are repeated because they feed into blockchain technology. Thus, it makes sense from a structural perspective to revisit certain important aspects and understand how they apply to the technology itself.

If you feel already very versed in the tech behind blockchain protocols, you can skip ahead to the next chapter for an [Introduction to Cosmos](../2-introduction-cosmos/index.md), or you can go through this short introduction as a refresher.

Have fun!
