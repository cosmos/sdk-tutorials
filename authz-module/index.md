# Authz Module

The [authz](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.44/modules/authz/) (authorization) module enables a granter to grant an authorization to a grantee that allows the grantee to execute messages on behalf of the granter. The authz module is different from the [auth](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.44/modules/auth/) (authentication) module that is responsible for specifying the base transaction and account types.

## Use Authz to Grant Authorizations

By implementing the authz module, Cosmos SDK application developers give users the ability to grant certain privileges to other users. For example, a user might want another user to vote on their behalf and so, rather than giving the other user access to their account, the user would grant an authorization that allows the other user to execute `MsgVote` on their behalf.

How users decide to use the authz module is up to them. In one case, a validator might want to create a separate account for voting in order to keep their validator key more secure. In another case, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) might want to distribute authorizations to members of the DAO in which case a multisg account would grant authorizations to individual accounts and members of the DAO would be able to execute messages without requiring signatures from all the other members.

In this tutorial, you spin up a single node network using the simulation application in Cosmos SDK (`simapp`), grant an authorization to another account, and then execute a message on behalf of the granter as the grantee.

## Requirements

Before you start the tutorial, you need to install the `simd` binary.

Clone the `cosmos-sdk` repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk
```

Change directories and check out `v0.44.0`:

```bash
cd cosmos-sdk && git checkout v0.44.0
```

Install the `simd` binary:

```bash
make install
```

Check to make sure the installation was successful:

```bash
simd version
```

You should see `0.44.0` printed to the console.

## Configuration

<!-- TODO: update tip to use `unsafe-reset-all` with better user experience -->

::: tip
If you have used `simd` before, you might already have a `.simapp` directory in your home directory. To keep the previous data, either save the directory to another location or use the `--home` flag and specify a different directory for each command in the following instructions. If you don't want to keep the previous data, remove the previous directory (`rm -rf ~/.simapp`).
:::

Run the following commands to configure the `simd` binary.

Set the chain ID:

```bash
simd config chain-id demo
```

Set the keyring backend:

```bash
simd config keyring-backend test
```

## Key Setup

Create a couple of test keys. Use the `--recover` option so that the addresses used in the following example commands are consistent.

Add a key for Alice:

```bash
simd keys add alice --recover
```

Enter the following mnemonic:

```bash
plunge hundred health electric victory foil marine elite shiver tonight away verify vacuum giant pencil ocean nest pledge okay endless try spirit special start
```

Add a key for Bob:

```bash
simd keys add bob --recover
```

Enter the following mnemonic:

```bash
shuffle oppose diagram wire rubber apart blame entire thought firm carry swim old head police panther lyrics road must silly sting dirt hard organ
```

## Chain Setup

The following commands set up a chain using the simulation application (`simapp`).

Initialize the node:

```bash
simd init test --chain-id demo
```

Add Alice and an initial balance to the genesis file:

```bash
simd add-genesis-account alice 5000000000stake --keyring-backend test
```

Add Bob and an initial balance to the genesis file:

```bash
simd add-genesis-account bob 5000000000stake --keyring-backend test
```

Generate a transaction to add Alice to the initial validator set:

```bash
simd gentx alice 1000000stake --chain-id demo
```

Add the validator transaction to the genesis file:

```bash
simd collect-gentxs
```

## Start Chain

You are now ready to start a single node network on your local machine.

Start the chain:

```bash
simd start
```

## Submit Proposal

To demonstrate an authorization to vote on a governance proposal, you must first create a governance proposal. The following command creates a text proposal that includes the minimun deposit, which allows the governance proposal to immediately enter the voting period. For more information about the command and the flag options, run `simd tx gov submit-proposal --help`.

Create proposal:

```bash
simd tx gov submit-proposal --title="Test Authorization" --description="Is Bob authorized to vote?" --type="Text" --deposit="10000000stake" --from alice
```

View proposal:

```bash
simd q gov proposal 1
```

## Grant Authorization

Next, the granter must `grant` an authorization to the grantee.

The authorization is a "generic" authorization, which is one that takes a message type (such as `MsgVote`) as a parameter and allows the grantee unlimited authorization to execute that message on behalf of the granter. Other [authorization types](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.44/modules/authz/01_concepts.html#built-in-authorizations) include "send", "delegate", "unbond", and "redelegate" in which case a limit on the amount of tokens can be set by the granter. In this case, the grantee is able to vote as many times as they want until the granter revokes the authorization.

Create authorization:

```bash
simd tx authz grant cosmos1khljzagdncfs03x5g6rf9qp5p93z9qgc3w5dwt generic --msg-type /cosmos.gov.v1beta1.MsgVote --from alice
```

View authorization:

```bash
simd q authz grants cosmos1jxd2uhx0j6e59306jq3jfqs7rhs7cnhvey4lqh cosmos1khljzagdncfs03x5g6rf9qp5p93z9qgc3w5dwt /cosmos.gov.v1beta1.MsgVote
```

## Generate Transaction

In order for the grantee to execute a message on behalf of the granter, the grantee must first generate an unsigned transaction where the transaction author (the `--from` address) is the granter. 

Create unsigned transaction:

```bash
simd tx gov vote 1 yes --from cosmos1jxd2uhx0j6e59306jq3jfqs7rhs7cnhvey4lqh --generate-only > tx.json
```

View transaction:

```bash
cat tx.json
```

## Execute Transaction

Finally, the grantee can sign and send the transaction using the `exec` command. The author of the transaction (the `--from` address) is the grantee.

Sign and send transaction:

```bash
simd tx authz exec tx.json --from bob
```

View vote:

```bash
simd q gov vote 1 cosmos1jxd2uhx0j6e59306jq3jfqs7rhs7cnhvey4lqh
```

## Revoke Authorization

The granter can revoke the authorization from the grantee using the `revoke` command.

Revoke authorization:

```bash
simd tx authz revoke cosmos1khljzagdncfs03x5g6rf9qp5p93z9qgc3w5dwt /cosmos.gov.v1beta1.MsgVote --from alice
```

View authorization:

```bash
simd q authz grants cosmos1jxd2uhx0j6e59306jq3jfqs7rhs7cnhvey4lqh cosmos1khljzagdncfs03x5g6rf9qp5p93z9qgc3w5dwt /cosmos.gov.v1beta1.MsgVote
```
