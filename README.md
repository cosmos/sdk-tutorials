2. Makefile 

# Makefile To-Do List

1. **Add a `test` task:** This task should run your unit tests. You can use the `go test` command to run your tests.

2. **Add a `test-integration` task:** This task should run your integration tests. You can use the `go test` command to run your tests in your integration test directory.

3. **Add a `proto-all` task:** This task should run all your Protobuf-related tasks. It should depend on `proto-format`, `proto-lint`, and `proto-gen`.

4. **Add a `proto-gen` task:** This task should generate Go code from your Protobuf files. You can use the `protoc` command to generate the code.

5. **Add a `proto-format` task:** This task should format your Protobuf files. You can use the `clang-format` command to format your files.

6. **Add a `proto-lint` task:** This task should lint your Protobuf files. You can use the `buf lint` command to lint your files.

7. **Add a `lint` task:** This task should run your linter on your Go code. You can use the `golangci-lint` command to lint your code.

8. **Add a `lint-fix` task:** This task should run your linter on your Go code and automatically fix any issues that it can. You can use the `golangci-lint` command with the `--fix` option to do this.

9. **Add an `install` task:** This task should build and install your application. You can use the `go install` command to do this.

10. **Add a `build` task:** This task should build your application without installing it. You can use the `go build` command to do this.

Remember to replace any placeholders with the actual values for your project. For example, replace `./...` with the actual path to your Go packages or Protobuf files.
