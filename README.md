This repo contains the code and content for the [Developer Portal](https://developers.cosmos.network/) and the [Interchain Developer Academy](https://academy.cosmos.network/).

Note: The layout metadata at the top of the README.md file controls how the tutorial page is published. Write permissions are limited to preserve the structure and contents.

These tutorials guide you through actionable steps and walk-throughs to teach you how to use the Cosmos Stack. The Cosmos Stack is the worldâ€™s most popular framework for building application-specific blockchains, it consists of several products:

- **Cosmos SDK**, a modular framework to build blockchain applications
- **IBC**, the Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol that allows blockchains to communicate 
- **Tendermint**, the algorithm that provides the consensus and networking layer for your blockchain application

The Developer Portal contains three types of content:
- **Concepts**, informational content explaining the how the Cosmos Stack functions
- **Individual Tutorials**, short tutorials to get you up to speed with individual components
- **Checkers Game**, a modular tutorial that covers the full stack and teaches you every element from set-up to launching in production with a front-end application attached.

Going through the entire content will teach you about:

* Blockchain technology and cryptography
* Developing with the Cosmos SDK & Ignite CLI
* The Tendermint consensus algorithm
* The Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol
* Building front- and backends with CosmJS
* Integrating wallets such as Keplr
* Relaying in the Cosmos Network

The code and docs for each tutorial are based on a specific version of the software. Be sure to follow the tutorial instructions to download and use the right version.

Use the tutorials landing page as your entry point to articles on [Cosmos blog](https://blog.cosmos.network/), videos on [Cosmos YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/CosmosProject/videos), and ways to get help and support.

This repo manages and publishes the tutorials. For details, see [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [TECHNICAL-SETUP](TECHNICAL-SETUP.md).
The tutorials are formatted using [markdownlint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint/blob/main/doc/Rules.md).
