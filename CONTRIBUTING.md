# Cosmos SDK Tutorials repo

This repository contains the code and content for the published [Cosmos SDK Tutorials](https://tutorials.cosmos.network/).

## Most Tutorials are Version-Specific

If the tutorial instructs you to download a specific version, that means that the code and the docs for each tutorial are tested, supported, and based on a specific version of the software. Be sure to download and use the right version.

## Contributing

Thank you for helping us to create and maintain this awesome developer portal.

* To set up the portal locally, please follow the [Local setup and build](TECHNICAL-SETUP.md#local-setup-and-build) guide in the [TECHNICAL SETUP](TECHNICAL-SETUP.md) document. You might also want to read the [further environment tips](TECHNICAL_SETUP.md#Environments) in that file.
* To provide feedback, file an issue and provide abundant details to help us understand how we can make it better.
* To provide feedback and a fix, you can make a direct contribution. This repo is protected since we provide the code and the docs to help you learn. If you're not a member or maintainer, fork the repo and then submit a Pull Request from your forked repo to master.

### Language and Style

### Pull Request

When you submit your PR, please use the default [Pull Request template](/.github/pull_request_template.md).

## Platform configuration and use

This documentation platform is using [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) with a [custom theme](https://github.com/b9lab/vuepress-theme-cosmos/tree/b9lab-theme-updates), which is referenced in this repo as [Submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules).

The main VuePress configuration file is located at `.vuepress/config.js`.

### README Metadata

The layout metadata at the top of the README.md file controls the main landingpage (`/`). Write permissions are limited to preserve the structure and contents.

### Folder structure

The published content currently lives in a few separate folders:

* `academy` contains the _Cosmos Academy_ content
* `tutorials` contains specific tutorials on different topics
* `hands-on-exercise` contains the hands-on modules

**Note:** The folder `ida-customizations` contains files used for the IDA build of the platform.

### Components and advanced features

There is a hidden file (not linked in the main menu) published at [/feature-test](/feature-test/index.md), which demonstrates the use of all custom components used on this platform. This page is also available on the deployed website at [https://tutorials.cosmos.network/feature-test/](https://tutorials.cosmos.network/feature-test/). You can always refer to this page when you need a reference for a component integration.

## Images

**Please note that images _must_ be linked using an absolute path!**

### SVG Images

A special note on svg images: They are currently not processed by the asset pipeline, therefore, svgs must be placed in a static asset folder (`.vuepress/public/`). Landingpage images are stored in the `lp-images` sub-folder. To embed such an image, you can embed `/lp-images/go-lp.svg`, which then points to the file at `.vuepress/public/lp-images/go-lp.svg`.

## Who works on the tutorials?

Meet the people [behind the Cosmos SDK and contributors](https://github.com/cosmos/sdk-tutorials/graphs/contributors).

## Viewing Tutorial Builds

There are two ways to see what your changes will look like in production before the updated pages are published:

* When a PR is ready for review, you can see a preview deployment.
* While a PR is in DRAFT mode, you can preview a local build.

### Preview PRs on a Deployed Preview

After the PR moves from **Draft** to **Ready for review**, the CI status checks generate a Netlify deploy preview. Netlify keeps this preview up to date as you continue to work and commit new changes to the same branch.

To view a deployed preview on a **Ready for review** PR, click the **Details** link on the netlify commit status line:

![deploy-preview](./deploy-preview.png)

### Preview Draft PRs on a Local Web Browser

To view a local preview of a branch, follow the steps outlined in the [TECHNICAL SETUP](TECHNICAL-SETUP.md) guide to clone and install the app. Then, checkout the branch you would like to preview and run:

```
npm run serve
```

to start the local server.

A successful client compile looks like: `> VuePress dev server listening at http://localhost:8080/ âœ” Client Compiled successfully in 280.71ms success [12:06:28] Build 03d41f finished in 283 ms! ( http://localhost:8080/ )`

You can now view the tutorial build on a local web browser at `http://localhost:8080/`.
