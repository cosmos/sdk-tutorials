# Cosmos SDK Tutorials repo

This repo contains the code and content for the published [Cosmos SDK Tutorials](https://tutorials.cosmos.network/).

## Tutorials are version-specific

The code and the docs for each tutorial are based on a specific version of the software. Be sure to download and use the right version.

## Contributing

Thank you for helping us to create and maintain awesome tutorials.

## Metadata

The layout metadata at the top of the README.md file controls how the tutorial page is published. Write permissions are limited to preserve the structure and contents.

## Folder structure

Each Cosmos SDK tutorial lives in a self-describing folder: `blog`, `hello-world`, `voter`, and so on.

Two sub-folders are present for most of the production-ready tutorials:

- A self-describing sub-folder for the app and the rest of the code that runs the tutorial.
- A `tutorial` sub-folder for the Markdown files (*.md) that build the published tutorial docs.

Work-in-process tutorials might have content and code in other repos.

## Viewing Tutorial Builds

There are two ways to see what your changes will look like in production before the updated pages are published.

- When a PR is ready for review, you can see a deployed preview on a URL that is unique for that PR.
- While a PR is in DRAFT mode, you can preview a local build.

### Preview PRs on a Deployed Preview

After the PR moves from **Draft** to **Ready for review**, the CI status checks generate a Netlify deploy preview. Netlify keeps this preview up to date as you continue to work and commit new changes to the same branch.

To view a deployed preview on a **Ready for review** PR, click the **Details** link on the netlify commit status line:

### Preview Draft PRs on a Local Web Browser

Since the deploy preview doesn't work on Draft PRs, follow these steps to preview the tutorial build on a local web browser.

1. If you haven't already, clone the tutorials repo to your local machine and change to that directory. For example:

    ```bash
    cd ~/github
    git clone https://github.com/cosmos/sdk-tutorials
    cd sdk-tutorials
    ```

2. Local tutorials require JavaScript. If needed, install [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/commands/npm-install).

3. For each branch you work in, install the npm packages for the SDK tutorials:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Start the local instance of the tutorial build:

    ```bash
    npm run serve
    ```

  A successful client compile looks like: `> VuePress dev server listening at http://localhost:8080/ âœ” Client Compiled successfully in 280.71ms success [12:06:28] Build 03d41f finished in 283 ms! ( http://localhost:8080/ )`

5. You can now view the tutorial build on a local web browser. Isn't this fun?

    Tip: On a mac, press the command key and click `http://localhost:8080/` for quick access.
