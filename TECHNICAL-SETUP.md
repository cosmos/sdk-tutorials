# Setting Up Visual Studio Code 

1. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://vscode-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/editor/setup/).
1. Click **Extensions** in the sidebar. 
1. Install these extensions:
    * [Go for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=golang.Go)
    * [markdownlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint) 
2. When prompted:
    * `go get -v golang.org/x/tools/gopls`
    * Select `Install all` for all packages

Be sure to set up [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview) for your environment. 

**Tip** On MacOS, install `code` in $PATH to enable [Launching Visual Studio Code from the command line](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac#_launching-from-the-command-line). Open the Command Palette (Cmd+Shift+P) and type 'shell command'.  

## GitHub Integration

Click the GitHub icon in the sidebar for GitHub integration and follow the prompts.

## Clone the repos you work in

* Fork or clone the <https://github.com/cosmos/sdk-tutorials/> repository. Internal Tendermint users have different permissions, if you're not sure, fork the repo.


## Terminal Tips 

Master your terminal to be happy.

### iTerm2 Terminal Emulator

On macOS, install the [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) OSS terminal emulator as a replacement for the default Terminal app. Installing iTerm2 as a replacement for Terminal provides an updated version of the Bash shell that supports useful features like programmable completion.

### Using ZSH as Your Default Shell

The Z shell, also known as zsh, is a UNIX shell that is built on top of the macOS default Bourne shell.

1. If you want to set your default shell to zsh, install and set up [zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Installing-ZSH) as the default shell.

1. Install these plugins:
    * [zsh-auto-suggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions/blob/master/INSTALL.md#oh-my-zsh)
    * [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting/blob/master/INSTALL.md#oh-my-zsh)

1. Edit your `~/.zshrc` file to add the plugins to load on startup:

    ```sh
    plugins=(
      git
      zsh-autosuggestions
      zsh-syntax-highlighting
    )
    ```

1. Log out and log back in to the terminal to use your new default zsh shell.


## Install Go 

This installation method removes existing Go installations, installs Go in `/usr/local/go/bin/go`, and sets the environment variables.

1. Go to <https://golang.org/dl>.
1. Download the binary release that is suitable for your system. 
1. Follow the installation instructions.

**Note:** We recommend not using brew to install Go.
