# Running a Node, API, and CLI

## Simapp

Run a blockhain and discover how to interact with it. 

Start with an educational sample called [Simapp](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/master/simapp/).

Firstm create a folder and clone the cosmos-sdk into that folder:

```bash
$ mkdir cosmos
$ cd cosmos
$ git clone https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk
```

Then build the cosmos-sdk:

```bash
$ cd cosmos-sdk
$ make build
```

This may take a few minutes. It will create a build folder and a simapp binary:

```bash
$ ls build
```

Now, reset the database. The database will be in the initial state in any case if this is the first time you have used (which will be in the initial state anyway if this is the first time you are testing simapp:

```bash
$ ./simd unsafe-reset-all

3:58PM INF Removed all blockchain history dir=/Users/b9lab/.simapp/data
3:58PM INF Generated private validator file keyFile=/Users/b9lab/.simapp/config/priv_validator_key.json stateFile=/Users/b9lab/.simapp/data/priv_validator_state.json
```

As you can see, it will list the files set to the initial state and their locations.

Now, initialize the application. Initialization creates the genesis block and initial chain state:

```bash
$ ./simd init demo

```

In the output you can see that your chain_id is test-chain-rT4wZY. We could determine the chainid by passing the flag --chain-id.

Inspect the initial configuration:

```bash
$ cat ~/.simapp/config/genesis.json 
```

Inspect your keys. These are held in the backend keyring which is operating system key ring by default:

```bash
$ ./simd keys list
[]

```

As you might have expected, you do not have any keys yet. Add a new key:

```bash
$ ./simd keys add b9lab

- name: b9lab
  type: local
  address: cosmos1nw793j9xvdzl2uc9ly8fas5tcfwfetercpdfqq
  pubkey: '{"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.secp256k1.PubKey","key":"A6TrsRO/OH91fAEFLohw7RwFB832NRsRWhQvE2t8cfLK"}'
  mnemonic: ""


**Important** write this mnemonic phrase in a safe place.
It is the only way to recover your account if you ever forget your password.

ivory uniform actual spot floor vessel monster rose yellow noise smile odor veteran human reason miss stadium phrase assault puzzle sentence approve coral apology
```

You can see the mnemonic at the end of the output:
```bash
ivory uniform actual spot floor vessel monster rose yellow noise smile odor veteran human reason miss stadium phrase assault puzzle sentence approve coral apology
```

Tis sequence of words is a mnemonic you can use to recover your public and private keys. In a production setting, the mnenonic should be stored in a reliable and confidential fashion such as a key-management infrastructure. 

Confirm that the key is has been added:

```bash
$ ./simd keys list
```

or with:

```bash
$ ./simd keys show b9lab
```

A cosmos-sdk blockchain relies on validators to produce blocks. Validators are normally added and removed through an on-chain governance process. The governance process relies on transactions to execute changes. Initially, there is no validator to generate the block with a transaction that adds a validator. Your chain needs a validator account for bootstrapping purposes. Defining an account to serve as a validator at the outsets breaks the circular dependency that would otherwise exist. 

Add your key (also know as an account) to the genesis file:

```bash
$ ./simd add-genesis-account b9lab 100000000stake
```

The suffix, stake appended to the amount and configured in the genesis file is the unit for the tokens in this chain. This command `100000000` to your account. Check it with:

```bash
$ cat ~/.simapp/config/genesis.json | grep -A 2 -B 2 stake
```

Because your blockchain is not actually running yet, you need to include bootstrap transactions in the genesis file.


Note: In this scenario, you will need the 2/3 threshold for validation, so you will stake 70000000stake of our 100000000stake in the b9lab account we just created. 

```bash
$ ./simd gentx b9lab 70000000stake --chain-id test-chain-rT4wZY
Genesis transaction written to "/Users/muratoener/.simapp/config/gentx/gentx-cf6bff39bb84da39d214138ebba8bcba4ccb848d.json"
```

Update your genesis file:

```bash
$ ./simd collect-gentxs

```

Now, start your blockchain:

```bash
$ ./simd start

6:23PM INF starting ABCI with Tendermint
6:23PM INF Starting multiAppConn service impl=multiAppConn module=proxy
6:23PM INF Starting localClient service connection=query impl=localClient module=abci-client
6:23PM INF Starting localClient service connection=snapshot impl=localClient module=abci-client
6:23PM INF Starting localClient service connection=mempool impl=localClient module=abci-client
6:23PM INF Starting localClient service connection=consensus impl=localClient module=abci-client

```

You will see blocks producing and validating. Open a new terminal and check the balances:

```bash
$ ./simd query bank balances $(./simd keys show b9lab -a)
balances:
- amount: "30000000"
  denom: stake
pagination:
  next_key: null
  total: "0"
```

Create another key for a student and send it some tokens:

```bash
$ ./simd keys add student

- name: student
  type: local
  address: cosmos1m95dh3uc2s7fkn4w6v3ueux3sya96dhdudwa24
  pubkey: '{"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.secp256k1.PubKey","key":"AgDYHucSs5vZ4viGyyoC0Qz6M7/+fEdqgOesEmeTdPE/"}'
  mnemonic: ""


**Important** record this mnemonic phrase in a safe place.
It is the only way to recover your account if you ever forget your password.

```

Confirm the balance of the new account:

```bash
$ ./simd query bank balances $(./simd keys show student -a)
balances: []
pagination:
  next_key: null
  total: "0"
```

This account does not have a balance. In fact, it is not in the blockchain yet. We need to send a transaction to change this new accounts balance:

```bash
$./simd tx bank send $(./simd keys show b9lab -a) $(./simd keys show student -a) 10stake --chain-id test-chain-rT4wZY

{"body":{"messages":[{"@type":"/cosmos.bank.v1beta1.MsgSend","from_address":"cosmos1nw793j9xvdzl2uc9ly8fas5tcfwfetercpdfqq","to_address":"cosmos1m95dh3uc2s7fkn4w6v3ueux3sya96dhdudwa24","amount":[{"denom":"stake","amount":"10"}]}],"memo":"","timeout_height":"0","extension_options":[],"non_critical_extension_options":[]},"auth_info":{"signer_infos":[],"fee":{"amount":[],"gas_limit":"200000","payer":"","granter":""},"tip":null},"signatures":[]}

```

As you can see, it will ask you to confirm the signing and broadcasting and shows you usefull information such as gas_used.

Now check the balance of the student again:

```bash
./simd query bank balances $(./simd keys show student -a)
balances:
- amount: "10"
  denom: stake
pagination:
  next_key: null
  total: "0"
```

## CLI

Inspect cosmos-sdk/simapp/simd/main.go:

```golang
package main

import (
  "os"

  "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/server"
  svrcmd "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/server/cmd"
  "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/simapp"
  "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/simapp/simd/cmd"
)

func main() {
  rootCmd, _ := cmd.NewRootCmd()

  if err := svrcmd.Execute(rootCmd, simapp.DefaultNodeHome); err != nil {
    switch e := err.(type) {
    case server.ErrorCode:
      os.Exit(e.Code)

    default:
      os.Exit(1)
    }
  }
}

```

You can see, it imports github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/simapp/simd/cmd for the CLI, which you can see at cosmos-sdk/simapp/simd/cmd/root.go:

```golang
func NewRootCmd() (*cobra.Command, params.EncodingConfig) {
```

Basic properties such as the application name are defined:

```golang
rootCmd := &cobra.Command{
    Use:   "simd",
    Short: "simulation app",
```


In addition, observe that cobra is imported and used for the CLI:

```golang

  rootCmd.AddCommand(
    genutilcli.InitCmd(simapp.ModuleBasics, simapp.DefaultNodeHome),
    genutilcli.CollectGenTxsCmd(banktypes.GenesisBalancesIterator{}, simapp.DefaultNodeHome),
    genutilcli.MigrateGenesisCmd(),
    genutilcli.GenTxCmd(simapp.ModuleBasics, encodingConfig.TxConfig, banktypes.GenesisBalancesIterator{}, simapp.DefaultNodeHome),
    genutilcli.ValidateGenesisCmd(simapp.ModuleBasics),
    AddGenesisAccountCmd(simapp.DefaultNodeHome),
    tmcli.NewCompletionCmd(rootCmd, true),
    NewTestnetCmd(simapp.ModuleBasics, banktypes.GenesisBalancesIterator{}),
    debug.Cmd(),
    config.Cmd(),
  )
```

Also explain `app.go` in which each module and keykeeper will be imported. The first thing you will see is a considerable list of modules that are used by most cosmos-sdk apps:

```golang
...
  "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/x/auth"
  "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/x/auth/ante"
  authkeeper "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/x/auth/keeper"
  authsims "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/x/auth/simulation"
  authtx "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/x/auth/tx"
  authtypes "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/x/auth/types"
  "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/x/auth/vesting"
  "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/x/bank"
  bankkeeper "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/x/bank/keeper"
  banktypes "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/x/bank/types"
  "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/x/capability"
  capabilitykeeper "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/x/capability/keeper"
  capabilitytypes "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/x/capability/types"
...

```

The modules in the `/cosmos-sdk/x/` folder are maintained by the Cosmos team. To understand a module, best way is to have a look at the according `spec` folder. Have a look at the `cosmos-sdk/x/bank/spec/01_state.md` to understand the state of the bank module which we used in this section.
