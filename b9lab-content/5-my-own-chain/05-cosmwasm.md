# CosmWasm

CosmWasm offers multi-chain solutions for smart contracts through an actor model design focused on providing a library.

<div class="tip">
The actor model is a design pattern for reliable, distributed systems. It is the pattern underlying CosmWasm smart contracts. In the model, the actor has access to the internal state, and actors can only message each other through a so-called dispatcher, that maintains the state and maps addresses to code and storage.
Want to read more on the actor model? Check out <a href="https://docs.cosmwasm.com/docs/0.16/architecture/actor">the CosmWasm documentation</a>.
</div>

CosmWasm is designed so that the code is agnostic to the details of underlying chains. CosmWasm only requires a Cosmos SDK application to embed the `Wasm` module. 

CosmWasm is adaptable to different development environments by design and makes it possible to connect chains. It is a solid platform to develop on because:
* If you want to change chains, you can easily transfer smart contracts and dApps.
* If your application grows, you can launch your chain for the next version of your smart contract and you do not need to compile and deploy the binaries again.

## Install

As usual with the Cosmos SDK, you will need to have installed Go. In addition, you will install Rust in order to write smart contracts. Go to https://rustup.rs/ and install Rust. Set the wasm32 target:

```bash
$ rustup target list --installed
$ rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

Create a folder and clone the [wasmd](https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd) repository into it:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd.git
$ cd wasmd
$ git checkout v0.18.0
$ make install
```

Verify your installation:

```bash
$ wasmd version
```

In case you cannot call `wasmd`, make sure your `$GOPATH` and `$PATH` are set correctly. 
`wasmd` is the easiest way to get started. It is forked from [gaiad](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia) and includes the [Wasm](https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd/tree/master/x/wasm) module.

## Testnet

You will first test the `wasmd` client with the [Pebblenet](https://github.com/CosmWasm/testnets/tree/master/pebblenet-1) testnet. `wasmd` is configured via environment variables. Export the most [recent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CosmWasm/testnets/master/pebblenet-1/defaults.env) environment:

```bash
$ export CHAIN_ID="pebblenet-1"
$ export TESTNET_NAME="pebblenet-1"
$ export FEE_DENOM="upebble"
$ export STAKE_DENOM="urock"
$ export BECH32_HRP="wasm"
$ export WASMD_VERSION="v0.18.0"
$ export CONFIG_DIR=".wasmd"
$ export BINARY="wasmd"

$ export COSMJS_VERSION="v0.26.0"
$ export GENESIS_URL="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CosmWasm/testnets/master/pebblenet-1/config/genesis.json"
$ export APP_CONFIG_URL="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CosmWasm/testnets/master/pebblenet-1/config/app.toml"
$ export CONFIG_URL="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CosmWasm/testnets/master/pebblenet-1/config/config.toml"

$ export RPC="https://rpc.pebblenet.cosmwasm.com:443"
$ export LCD="https://lcd.pebblenet.cosmwasm.com"
$ export FAUCET="https://faucet.pebblenet.cosmwasm.com"

$ export COSMOVISOR_VERSION="v0.42.9"
$ export COSMOVISOR_HOME=$HOME/.wasmd
$ export COSMOVISOR_NAME=wasmd
```

Now add some keys:

```bash
$ wasmd keys add wallet
$ wasmd keys add wallet2
```

Install [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/), and request some tokens from the [faucet](https://faucet.pebblenet.cosmwasm.com) for the `wallet`:

```bash
$ JSON=$(jq -n --arg addr $(wasmd keys show -a wallet) '{"denom":"upebble","address":$addr}') && curl -X POST --header "Content-Type: application/json" --data "$JSON" https://faucet.pebblenet.cosmwasm.com/credit
```

Do the same for `wallet2`. Now, check the balances:

```bash
$ wasmd query bank balances $(wasmd keys show wallet --address) --node $RPC
$ wasmd query bank balances $(wasmd keys show wallet2 --address) --node $RPC
```

In another location, clone the contract samples:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/InterWasm/cw-contracts
$ cd cw-contracts/contracts/
$ cargo wasm
```

In the last command, `wasm` is an alias for `wasm build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown`. Check the size of your build with:

```bash
$ ls -lh target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/cw_nameservice.wasm
```

As in the case of developing on other blockchains, you want to maintain your smart contract as small as possible. For production purposes, you will optimize the code with a [docker](https://www.docker.com/) container based on an [image provided by CosmWasm](https://hub.docker.com/r/cosmwasm/rust-optimizer/tags):

```bash
$ docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/code \
  --mount type=volume,source="$(basename "$(pwd)")_cache",target=/code/target \
  --mount type=volume,source=registry_cache,target=/usr/local/cargo/registry \
  cosmwasm/rust-optimizer:0.12.3
```

Compare the result:

```bash
$ ls -allh artifacts/cw_nameservice.wasm 
```

Now upload the contract to the blockchain:

```bash
$ RES=$(wasmd tx wasm store artifacts/cw_nameservice.wasm --from wallet --node $RPC --chain-id pebblenet-1 --gas-prices 0.001upebble --gas auto --gas-adjustment 1.3)
$ CODE_ID=$(echo $RES | jq -r '.logs[0].events[-1].attributes[0].value')
```

The response will return a `code_id` value, which you will use in the next steps.

In `contracts/nameservice/src/contract.rs` you see:

```rust
#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn instantiate(
    deps: DepsMut,
    _env: Env,
    _info: MessageInfo,
    msg: InstantiateMsg,
) -> Result<Response, StdError> {
    let config_state = Config {
        purchase_price: msg.purchase_price,
        transfer_price: msg.transfer_price,
    };

    config(deps.storage).save(&config_state)?;

    Ok(Response::default())
}
```

where `msg.purchase_price` and `msg.transfer_price` have the type of [cosmwasm_std::Coin](https://docs.rs/cosmwasm-std/0.9.2/cosmwasm_std/struct.Coin.html). So you will instantiate the contract with a `purchase_price` and `transfer_price` with:

```bash
$ wasmd tx wasm instantiate $CODE_ID '{"purchase_price":{"amount":"100","denom":"upebble"},"transfer_price":{"amount":"999","denom":"upebble"}}' --from wallet --node $RPC --chain-id pebblenet-1 --gas-prices 0.001upebble --gas auto --gas-adjustment 1.3  --label "CosmWasm tutorial name service"
```

Replace `$CODE_ID` with the `code_id` you got from the previous response. 

Check the contract:

```bash
$ wasmd query wasm list-contract-by-code $CODE_ID --node $RPC --output json
```

In the response, you will find the contract address. Use it to fetch more information and replace `$CONTRACT` in the following command with the address you got:


```bash
$ wasmd query wasm contract $CONTRACT --node $RPC
```

After the initialisation you can call the contract. In `contract.rs` you will find:

```rust
#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn execute(
    deps: DepsMut,
    env: Env,
    info: MessageInfo,
    msg: ExecuteMsg,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
    match msg {
        ExecuteMsg::Register { name } => execute_register(deps, env, info, name),
        ExecuteMsg::Transfer { name, to } => execute_transfer(deps, env, info, name, to),
    }
}
```

So, we can register or transfer a name. First register a name with your contract address `$CONTRACT`:

```bash
$ wasmd tx wasm execute $CONTRACT '{"register":{"name":"fred"}}' --amount 100upebble --from wallet --node $RPC --chain-id pebblenet-1 --gas-prices 0.001upebble --gas auto --gas-adjustment 1.3
```

In the contract you will find:

```rust
pub fn query(deps: Deps, env: Env, msg: QueryMsg) -> StdResult<Binary> {
    match msg {
        QueryMsg::ResolveRecord { name } => query_resolver(deps, env, name),
        QueryMsg::Config {} => to_binary(&config_read(deps.storage).load()?),
    }
}
```

There are two queries. Note that we now have `deps: Deps` instead of `deps: DepsMut`.

<div class="tip">
We will keep this section as an introduction, so please try to figure out the reason with the help of the links at the end of this section. 
</div>

Verify the registration with `ResolveRecord`:

```bash
$ wasmd query wasm contract-state smart $CONTRACT '{"resolve_record": {"name": "fred"}}' --node $RPC --output json
```

The reponse will give you the wallet address, if the name is registered. Transfer the name to the second wallet:

```bash
$ wasmd tx wasm execute $CONTRACT '{"transfer":{"name":"fred","to":"wasm17a6xrje3vnhmevp0tflwt6t0dv2faz5sa3l2lq"}}' --amount 999upebble --from wallet --node $RPC --chain-id pebblenet-1 --gas-prices 0.001upebble --gas auto --gas-adjustment 1.3
```

Replace the address `wasm17a6xrje3vnhmevp0tflwt6t0dv2faz5sa3l2lq` with the address of your second wallet:

```
$ wasmd keys show wallet2 --address
```

Note that we used `transfer_price`, which we set at the instantiation. Check again with a `resolve_record` query if the transfer was successful. Try to do another transfer from `wallet2` to `wallet`, and check which wallet is able to do such a transaction.
