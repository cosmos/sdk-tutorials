# Transactions

Transactions are objects created by end-users to trigger state changes in the application. They are comprised of metadata that defines a context and `sdk.Msgs` that trigger state changes within a module through the module’s Protobuf message service.

## Transaction Process, End-user

While there is much to explore as we journey through the stack, let us first describe the transaction process from a user perspective.

* **Decide** on the messages to put into the transaction. This is normally done with the assistance of a wallet or application and a user interface.
* **Generate** the transaction using the SDK's `TxBuilder`. `TxBuilder` is the preferred way for an application to generate a transaction.
* **Sign** the transaction. Transactions must be signed before the validators will include them in a block.
* **Broadcast** the signed transaction using one of the available interfaces.

From a user perspective, **decide** and **sign** are the main interactions, while **generate** and **broadcast** are attended by the user interface and other automations.

## Transaction Objects

Transaction objects are signed containers. They contain signed messages. Each message represents an action targeted at a given module. As a whole, a transaction therefore describes an indivisible set of actions that should take place. You can see its Protobuf description [here](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/0a3660d/proto/cosmos/tx/v1beta1/tx.proto#L14-L26). To make it a Cosmos SDK transaction, an object also has to conform to the `Tx` whose notable functions are:

* `GetMsgs`: unwraps the transaction and returns a list of contained `sdk.Msg` - one transaction may have one or multiple messages.
* `ValidateBasic`: includes lightweight, stateless checks used by ABCI message’s `CheckTx` and `DeliverTx` to make sure transactions are not invalid. For example, the auth module's StdTx ValidateBasic function checks that its transactions are signed by the correct number of signers and that the fees do not exceed the user's maximum. Note that this function is to be distinct from the ValidateBasic functions for sdk.Msgs, which perform basic validity checks on messages only. For example, when runTx is checking a transaction created from the auth module, it first runs ValidateBasic on each message, then runs the auth module AnteHandler which calls ValidateBasic for the transaction itself.

As a developer, you should rarely manipulate a Tx directly. It is an intermediate type used for transaction generation. Instead, developers should prefer the TxBuilder interface.

## Messages

<HighlightBox type=”info”>
Transaction messages are not to be confused with ABCI messages that define interactions between Tendermint and application layers.
</HighlightBox>

In this context, messages, or `sdk.Msgs` are module-specific objects that trigger state transitions within the scope of the module they belong to. Module developers define module messages by adding methods to the Protobuf Msg service and defining a `MsgServer`. Each `sdk.Msgs` is related to exactly one Protobuf Msg service RPC, defined inside each module's `tx.proto` file. A Cosmos SDK app router automatically maps every `sdk.Msg` to a corresponding RPC service which routes it to the appropriate method. Protobuf generates a MsgServer interface for each module Msg service, and the module developer implements this interface.

This design puts more responsibility on module developers, allowing application developers to reuse common functionalities without having to implement state transition logic repetitively.
While messages contain the information for state transition logic, a transaction's other metadata and relevant information are stored in the `TxBuilder` and `Context`.

## Transaction Generation

The TxBuilder interface contains metadata closely related to the generation of transactions. The end-user can freely set these parameters for the transaction to be generated.

* `Msgs`: the array of messages included in the transaction.
* `GasLimit`: option chosen by the users for how to calculate how much gas they are willing to spend.
* `Memo`: a note or comment to send with the transaction.
* `FeeAmount`: the maximum amount the user is willing to pay in fees.
* `TimeoutHeight`:, block height until which the transaction is valid.
* `Signatures`: the array of signatures from all signers of the transaction.

As there are currently two modes for signing transactions, there are also two implementations of TxBuilder.

* Wrapper for `SIGN_MODE_DIRECT`, which can sign transactions with both SIGN_MODE_DIRECT and SIGN_MODE_LEGACY_AMINO_JSON (recommended)
* StdTxBuilder, which can only sign with SIGN_MODE_LEGACY_AMINO_JSON

`TxConfig` is an app-wide configuration for managing transactions. Most importantly, it holds the information about whether to sign each transaction with SIGN_MODE_DIRECT or SIGN_MODE_LEGACY_AMINO_JSON. SIGN_MODE_DIRECT is recommended.

By calling `txBuilder := txConfig.NewTxBuilder()`, a new TxBuilder will be created with the appropriate sign mode.Once TxBuilder is correctly populated with the setters described above, `TxConfig` will also take care of correctly encoding the bytes (again, either using `SIGN_MODE_DIRECT` or `SIGN_MODE_LEGACY_AMINO_JSON`).

Here's a pseudo-code snippet of how to generate and encode a transaction, using the TxEncoder() method:

```
txBuilder := txConfig.NewTxBuilder()
txBuilder.SetMsgs(...) // and other setters on txBuilder
```

## Signing Transactions

Every message in a transaction must be signed by the addresses specified by its `GetSigners`. The SDK currently allows signing transactions in two different ways:

* `SIGN_MODE_DIRECT` (preferred): The most used implementation of the Tx interface is the Protobuf Tx message, which is used in SIGN_MODE_DIRECT, Once signed by all signers, the `body_bytes`, `auth_info_bytes` and signatures are gathered into `TxRaw`, whose serialized bytes are broadcasted over the network.

* `SIGN_MODE_LEGACY_AMINO_JSON`: The legacy implementation of the Tx interface is the StdTx struct from x/auth. The document signed by all signers is `StdSignDoc` which is encoded into bytes using Amino JSON. Once all signatures are gathered into StdTx, StdTx is serialized using Amino JSON, and these bytes are broadcasted over the network. This method is being deprecated.

## Broadcast the Transaction
Once the transaction bytes are generated and signed there are currently three primary ways of broadcasting it.

Application developers create entrypoints to the application by creating a command-line interface, gRPC and/or REST interface, typically found in the application's ./cmd folder. These interfaces allow users to interact with the application.

### CLI

For the command-line interface, module developers create subcommands to add as children to the application top-level transaction command, `TxCmd`.

CLI commands actually bundle all the steps of transaction processing into one simple command: creating messages, generating transactions, signing and broadcasting.

### gRPC
The principal usage of gRPC is in the context of module Query services.

The SDK also exposes a few other module-agnostic gRPC services, one of them being the Tx service
The Tx service exposes a handful of utility functions, such as simulating a transaction or querying a transaction, and also one method to broadcast transactions.

Example: [https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/master/docs/run-node/txs.md#programmatically-with-go](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/master/docs/run-node/txs.md#programmatically-with-go)

### REST
Each gRPC method has its corresponding REST endpoint, generated using gRPC-gateway.
Rather than using gRPC, you can also use HTTP to broadcast the same transaction, on the POST /cosmos/tx/v1beta1/txs endpoint.

Example: [https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/master/docs/run-node/txs.md#using-rest](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/master/docs/run-node/txs.md#using-rest)

Additionally:

### Tendermint RPC

The three methods presented above are actually higher abstractions over the Tendermint RPC /broadcast_tx_{async,sync,commit} endpoints.

Example: [https://docs.tendermint.com/master/rpc/#/Tx](https://docs.tendermint.com/master/rpc/#/Tx)
you can use the Tendermint RPC endpoints to directly broadcast the transaction through Tendermint, if you wish to.

## Long-running exercise

Previously, our ABCI application knew of a single transaction type, that of a checkers move, with 4 `int`. With multiple games, this is no longer sufficient. We need to add a transaction type to create a new game. When this is done, someone will create a new game, and this game will mention someone else, i.e. the other player, perhaps the 2 other players. Perhaps, it would be a good idea for the other person to be able to reject the challenge. It would have the added benefit of clearing the state of stale un-started games.

So here is what our transactions would look like in pseudo-code:

* The transaction to create a game:
    ```
    CreateGameTx struct {
        Sender: Address, // Anyone really.
        Message: CreateGameMsg struct {
            players: {
                black: Address,
                red: Address
            }
        }
    }
    ```
* The transaction to do a move, which means accepting the challenge when on a new game:
    ```
    MoveTx struct {
        Sender: Address, // One of the players to be valid.
        Message: MoveMsg struct {
            gameId: id type still to be decided,
            src: Pos struct {
                X int,
                Y int
            },
            dst: Pos struct {
                X int,
                Y int
            }
        }
    }
    ```
* The transaction to reject an un-started game:
    ```
    RejectTx struct {
        Sender: Address, // One of the players to be valid.
        Message: RejectMsg struct {
            gameId: id type still to be decided
        }
    }
    ```

We can already think about some game-theoretical situations. After all, a game involves 2 parties, and they may not always play nice.

* What would happen if 1 of the 2 players has accepted the game by playing, but the other player has neither accepted nor rejected the game? What we could do is:
    * Have a timeout after which the game is canceled. And this cancelation would be handled automatically, in `EndBlock` or whichever equivalent in Cosmos SDK, without any of the players having to trigger the cancelation.
    * Keep an index, a FIFO, or a list of un-started games ordered by cancelation time, so that this automatic trigger does not consume too many resources.
* What would happen if the player whose turn it is never shows up or never sends a valid transaction? What we could do is:
    * Have a timeout after which the game is forfeited.
    * Keep an index of games that could be forfeited. Actually, if both timeouts are the same, we can keep a single FIFO of games so that we clear from the head as necessary.

So we add `timeout: Timestamp` to our `FullGame`, and update it every time something changes in the game. We can decide on a maximum delay, 1 day?

Of note is that we do not have _open_ challenges whereby a player creates a game where the second player is unknown until someone steps in. So player matching is left outside of the blockchain. We leave it to the enterprising student to incorporate it inside the blockchain by changing all models.
