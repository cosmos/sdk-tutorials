<HighlightBox type="prerequisite">

Make sure you have all you need before proceeding:

* You understand the concepts of [migrations](/academy/2-cosmos-concepts/13-migrations.md), [production](/tutorials/9-path-to-prod/index.md), and [migrations in production](/tutorials/9-path-to-prod/7-migration.md).
* Docker is installed and you [understand it](/tutorials/5-docker-intro/index.md).
* You have the checkers blockchain codebase up to the migration. If not, follow the [previous steps](/hands-on-exercise/4-run-in-prod/2-migration.md) or check out the [relevant version](https://github.com/cosmos/b9-checkers-academy-draft/tree/migration).

</HighlightBox>

<HighlightBox type="learning">

In this section, you will:

* Prepare Docker elements.
* Deal with data migrations.
* Upgrade your blockchain in production with Cosmovisor.
* Compose everything in one orchestrated ensemble.
* Test it.

</HighlightBox>

# Simulate a migration in Docker

In previous sections, you have:

* Simulated a production setup with the help of Docker Compose.
* Learned how to implement an in-place migration.

This section is about:

* Running an in-place migration...
* ...in a simulated production setup...
* ...with the help of Docker Compose.

You will reuse the nodes, validators, and sentries created for Alice, Bob, and Carol in a [previous section](/hands-on-exercise/4-run-in-prod/1-run-prod-docker.md).

## What to expect

In this section, you will accomplish the following steps:

1. Build the checkers v1 software.
2. Build the checkers v2 software.
3. Build Cosmovisor and set it up for a known upgrade on all nodes.
4. Launch everything.
5. Create an upgrade governance proposal.
6. Have the proposal pass.
7. Observe the migration take place.
8. Stop everything and start it again safely.

In a real production situation, node operators would wait for a named upgrade governance proposal to be on the ballot (if not wait for it to be approved) before they went to the trouble of setting up Cosmovisor; therefore point 5 would happen some time before point 3. However, because we know that the proposal will go through, we will use the above order in the interest of time.

## Prepare checkers executables

At this stage, your checkers code already has the migration elements. It is therefore in its v2 configuration. Create the corresponding Docker image:

```sh
$ docker build . \
    -f prod-sim/Dockerfile-checkersd-alpine \
    -t checkersd_i:v2-alpine
```

To get to v1, you need to check out the code before all the migration code was added. This should be the [`run-prod`](https://github.com/cosmos/b9-checkers-academy-draft/tree/run-prod) branch.

```sh
$ git checkout run-prod
```

Now you can create checkers v1:

```sh
$ docker build . \
    -f prod-sim/Dockerfile-checkersd-alpine \
    -t checkersd_i:v1-alpine
```

## Blockchain elements

Since you are in the `run-prod` branch, your genesis elements should also be in v1. You can confirm this by verifying that there are no leaderboards in the [checkers genesis store](https://github.com/cosmos/b9-checkers-academy-draft/blob/run-prod/prod-sim/node-carol/config/genesis.json#L85).

As you did in the [migration section](/hands-on-exercise/4-run-in-prod/2-migration.md), you need to reduce the voting period from 2 days to 10 minutes to make the exercise bearable:

```sh
$ jq -j '.app_state.gov.voting_params.voting_period = "600s"' prod-sim/desk-alice/config/genesis.json > prod-sim/desk-alice/config/genesis-2.json && mv prod-sim/desk-alice/config/genesis-2.json prod-sim/desk-alice/config/genesis.json
$ jq -j '.app_state.gov.voting_params.voting_period = "600s"' prod-sim/desk-bob/config/genesis.json > prod-sim/desk-bob/config/genesis-2.json && mv prod-sim/desk-bob/config/genesis-2.json prod-sim/desk-bob/config/genesis.json
$ jq -j '.app_state.gov.voting_params.voting_period = "600s"' prod-sim/sentry-alice/config/genesis.json > prod-sim/sentry-alice/config/genesis-2.json && mv prod-sim/sentry-alice/config/genesis-2.json prod-sim/sentry-alice/config/genesis.json
$ jq -j '.app_state.gov.voting_params.voting_period = "600s"' prod-sim/sentry-bob/config/genesis.json > prod-sim/sentry-bob/config/genesis-2.json && mv prod-sim/sentry-bob/config/genesis-2.json prod-sim/sentry-bob/config/genesis.json
$ jq -j '.app_state.gov.voting_params.voting_period = "600s"' prod-sim/val-alice/config/genesis.json > prod-sim/val-alice/config/genesis-2.json && mv prod-sim/val-alice/config/genesis-2.json prod-sim/val-alice/config/genesis.json
$ jq -j '.app_state.gov.voting_params.voting_period = "600s"' prod-sim/val-bob/config/genesis.json > prod-sim/val-bob/config/genesis-2.json && mv prod-sim/val-bob/config/genesis-2.json prod-sim/val-bob/config/genesis.json
$ jq -j '.app_state.gov.voting_params.voting_period = "600s"' prod-sim/node-carol/config/genesis.json > prod-sim/node-carol/config/genesis-2.json && mv prod-sim/node-carol/config/genesis-2.json prod-sim/node-carol/config/genesis.json
```

The name of the upgrade proposal will be `v1tov2`. The name is important, as Cosmovisor uses it to determine which executable to run.

## Prepare the Cosmovisor executable

Because the project in its current state uses Cosmos SDK v0.45.4, to avoid any surprise you will prepare Cosmovisor at the [v0.45.4](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.45/run-node/cosmovisor.html) version too.

You can describe the steps in a new Dockerfile `prod-sim/Dockerfile-cosmovisor-alpine`, described here logically (before a recap lower down):

1. You need to build Cosmovisor from its code:

    ```Dockerfile [https://github.com/cosmos/b9-checkers-academy-draft/blob/migration-prod/prod-sim/Dockerfile-cosmovisor-alpine#L1-L25]
    FROM --platform=linux golang:1.18.7-alpine AS builder

    ENV COSMOS_VERSION=v0.45.4

    RUN apk update
    RUN apk add make git

    WORKDIR /root
    RUN git clone --depth 1 --branch ${COSMOS_VERSION} https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk.git

    WORKDIR /root/cosmos-sdk/cosmovisor

    RUN make cosmovisor

    FROM --platform=linux alpine

    ENV LOCAL=/usr/local

    COPY --from=builder /root/cosmos-sdk/cosmovisor/cosmovisor ${LOCAL}/bin/cosmovisor
    ```

2. Cosmovisor is instructed via [environment variables](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.45/run-node/cosmovisor.html#command-line-arguments-and-environment-variables). In the eventual containers, the `/root/.checkers` folder comes from a volume mount, so to avoid any conflict it is better not to put the `cosmovisor` folder directly inside it. Instead pick `/root/.checkers-upgrade`:

    ```diff [https://github.com/cosmos/b9-checkers-academy-draft/blob/migration-prod/prod-sim/Dockerfile-cosmovisor-alpine#L20-L23]
        ...
        FROM --platform=linux alpine
        
        ENV LOCAL=/usr/local
    +  ENV DAEMON_HOME=/root/.checkers-upgrade
    +  ENV DAEMON_NAME=checkersd
    +  ENV DAEMON_ALLOW_DOWNLOAD_BINARIES=false
    +  ENV DAEMON_RESTART_AFTER_UPGRADE=true
        ...
    ```

3. With the folder decided, you can introduce both the v1 and v2 checkers executables. They can be conveniently taken from their respective Docker images:

    ```diff [https://github.com/cosmos/b9-checkers-academy-draft/blob/migration-prod/prod-sim/Dockerfile-cosmovisor-alpine#L15-L27]
    +  FROM --platform=linux checkersd_i:v1-alpine AS v1
    +  FROM --platform=linux checkersd_i:v2-alpine AS v2
        FROM --platform=linux alpine
        ...
        COPY --from=builder /root/cosmos-sdk/cosmovisor/cosmovisor ${LOCAL}/bin/cosmovisor
    +  COPY --from=v1 /usr/local/bin/checkersd $DAEMON_HOME/cosmovisor/genesis/bin/checkersd
    +  COPY --from=v2 /usr/local/bin/checkersd $DAEMON_HOME/cosmovisor/upgrades/v1tov2/bin/checkersd
        ...
    ```

    Checkers starts at v1, therefore the v1 code goes into `.../genesis`, and we know that the code of the eventual upgrade named `v1tov2` is the v2. Note also the decision to use `/usr/local` explicitly, as this is knowledge that is kept in a separate Docker image.

4. Now make Cosmovisor start by default:

    ```diff [https://github.com/cosmos/b9-checkers-academy-draft/blob/migration-prod/prod-sim/Dockerfile-cosmovisor-alpine#L29]
        COPY --from=v2 /usr/local/bin/checkersd $DAEMON_HOME/cosmovisor/upgrades/v1tov2/bin/checkersd

    +  ENTRYPOINT [ "cosmovisor" ]
    ```

When you put all this together, you get:

```Dockerfile [https://github.com/cosmos/b9-checkers-academy-draft/blob/migration-prod/prod-sim/Dockerfile-cosmovisor-alpine]
FROM --platform=linux golang:1.18.7-alpine AS builder

ENV COSMOS_VERSION=v0.45.4

RUN apk update
RUN apk add make git

WORKDIR /root
RUN git clone --depth 1 --branch ${COSMOS_VERSION} https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk.git

WORKDIR /root/cosmos-sdk/cosmovisor

RUN make cosmovisor

FROM --platform=linux checkersd_i:v1-alpine AS v1
FROM --platform=linux checkersd_i:v2-alpine AS v2
FROM --platform=linux alpine

ENV LOCAL=/usr/local
ENV DAEMON_HOME=/root/.checkers-upgrade
ENV DAEMON_NAME=checkersd
ENV DAEMON_ALLOW_DOWNLOAD_BINARIES=false
ENV DAEMON_RESTART_AFTER_UPGRADE=true

COPY --from=builder /root/cosmos-sdk/cosmovisor/cosmovisor ${LOCAL}/bin/cosmovisor
COPY --from=v1 /usr/local/bin/checkersd $DAEMON_HOME/cosmovisor/genesis/bin/checkersd
COPY --from=v2 /usr/local/bin/checkersd $DAEMON_HOME/cosmovisor/upgrades/v1tov2/bin/checkersd

ENTRYPOINT [ "cosmovisor" ]
```

Now you can create the Cosmovisor Docker image with a meaningful tag:

```sh
$ docker build . \
    -f prod-sim/Dockerfile-cosmovisor-alpine \
    -t cosmovisor_i:v1tov2-alpine
```

## Docker Compose elements

With the executables and the blockchain elements ready, you can now define the _production setup_. You already defined one in the previous [run checkers in prod section](/hands-on-exercise/4-run-in-prod/1-run-prod-docker.md). In this new setup, the only things that change are the Docker images you call: `cosmovisor_i` instead of `checkersd_i`. Even the `start` command does not need to change.

To avoid rewriting everything, you can declare a Docker Compose [extension](https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends/) in a new file `prod-sim/docker-compose-cosmovisor.yml`. Each `checkersd` type of service is extended, and in the end is replaced, with a new `image`:

```yaml [https://github.com/cosmos/b9-checkers-academy-draft/blob/migration-prod/prod-sim/docker-compose-cosmovisor.yml]
version: "3.7"

services:

  val-alice:
    extends:
      file: docker-compose.yml
      service: val-alice
    image: cosmovisor_i:v1tov2-alpine

  sentry-alice:
    extends:
      file: docker-compose.yml
      service: sentry-alice
    image: cosmovisor_i:v1tov2-alpine

  val-bob:
    extends:
      file: docker-compose.yml
      service: val-bob
    image: cosmovisor_i:v1tov2-alpine

  sentry-bob:
    extends:
      file: docker-compose.yml
      service: sentry-bob
    image: cosmovisor_i:v1tov2-alpine

  node-carol:
    extends:
      file: docker-compose.yml
      service: node-carol
    image: cosmovisor_i:v1tov2-alpine
```

<HighlightBox type="note">

`docker-compose-cosmovisor.yml`'s `val-alice` extends `docker-compose.yml`'s `val-alice`, while keeping the same name. In effect this overwrites `val-alice`, instead of starting another validator working on the same shared `prod-sim/val-alice` folder.

</HighlightBox>

## Run all the elements

Now you can run everything and confirm that all services start:

```sh
$ docker compose \
    --file prod-sim/docker-compose.yml \
    --file prod-sim/docker-compose-cosmovisor.yml \
    --project-name checkers-prod up \
    --detach
```

In fact, at this stage there is no difference from the previous prod setup, which was what we now call v1. Blocks are being created.

Confirm you are on v1:

* One way to confirm is to use checkers v2 to query Carol's node for the leaderboard:

    ```sh
    $ docker run --rm -it \
        --network checkers-prod_net-public \
        checkersd_i:v2-alpine \
        query checkers show-leaderboard \
        --node "tcp://node-carol:26657"
    ```

    It returns:

    ```txt
    Error: rpc error: code = Unknown desc = unknown query path: unknown request
    ```

    This confirms that there are no leaderboards in storage.

* Another way to confirm is to see to which folder Cosmovisor's `current` folder is soft linking:

    ```sh
    $ docker exec -it node-carol \
        ls -l /root/.checkers-upgrade/cosmovisor/current
    ```

    This should return:

    ```txt
    ... /root/.checkers-upgrade/cosmovisor/current -> /root/.checkers-upgrade/cosmovisor/genesis
    ```

    Again, this confirms that it is running v1, as found in `.../genesis`.

## Make an upgrade proposal

You will now need Alice and Bob's addresses, so take them from the keyrings found on their respective _desktops_.

<CodeGroup>

<CodeGroupItem title="Alice">

```sh
$ alice=$(echo password | docker run --rm -i \
    -v $(pwd)/prod-sim/desk-alice:/root/.checkers \
    checkersd_i:v1-alpine \
    keys \
    --keyring-backend file --keyring-dir /root/.checkers/keys \
    show alice --address)
```

</CodeGroupItem>

<CodeGroupItem title="Bob">

```sh
$ bob=$(echo password | docker run --rm -i \
    -v $(pwd)/prod-sim/desk-bob:/root/.checkers \
    checkersd_i:v1-alpine \
    keys \
    --keyring-backend file --keyring-dir /root/.checkers/keys \
    show bob --address)
```

</CodeGroupItem>

</CodeGroup>

Copying what was done in the [previous migration section](/hands-on-exercise/4-run-in-prod/2-migration.md#governance-proposal), with one block every 5 seconds, you make a proposal to run in 15 minutes (i.e. 180 blocks).

Find the current block height with:

```sh
$ docker run --rm -it \
    --network checkers-prod_net-public \
    checkersd_i:v1-alpine status \
    --node "tcp://node-carol:26657" \
    | jq -r ".SyncInfo.latest_block_height"
```

This returns something like:

```txt
1000
```

With a minimum deposit of 10,000,000 upawn, you can now have Alice send the governance proposal from her desktop to Carol's public node:

```sh
$ echo password | docker run --rm -i \
    -v $(pwd)/prod-sim/desk-alice:/root/.checkers \
    --network checkers-prod_net-public \
    checkersd_i:v1-alpine \
    tx gov submit-proposal software-upgrade v1tov2 \
    --node "tcp://node-carol:26657" \
    --title "v1tov2" \
    --description "Increase engagement via the use of a leaderboard" \
    --upgrade-height 1180 \
    --deposit 10000000upawn \
    --from $alice --keyring-backend file --keyring-dir /root/.checkers/keys \
    --broadcast-mode block \
    --yes
```

The command is long but it makes sense when you look at it carefully. It returns you the proposal id:

```yaml
- attributes:
  - key: proposal_id
    value: "1"
  - key: proposal_type
    value: SoftwareUpgrade
  - key: voting_period_start
    value: "1"
```

## Vote on the proposal

Have both Alice and Bob vote "yes" on the proposal:

<CodeGroup>

<CodeGroupItem title="Alice">

```sh
echo password | docker run --rm -i \
    -v $(pwd)/prod-sim/desk-alice:/root/.checkers \
    --network checkers-prod_net-public \
    checkersd_i:v1-alpine \
    tx gov vote 1 yes \
    --node "tcp://node-carol:26657" \
    --from $alice --keyring-backend file --keyring-dir /root/.checkers/keys \
    --yes
```

</CodeGroupItem>

<CodeGroupItem title="Bob">

```sh
echo password | docker run --rm -i \
    -v $(pwd)/prod-sim/desk-bob:/root/.checkers \
    --network checkers-prod_net-public \
    checkersd_i:v1-alpine \
    tx gov vote 1 yes \
    --node "tcp://node-carol:26657" \
    --from $bob --keyring-backend file --keyring-dir /root/.checkers/keys \
    --yes
```

</CodeGroupItem>

</CodeGroup>

## Refill your cup

When the proposal voting period ends, check that the votes went through and what the latest block height is:

<CodeGroup>

<CodeGroupItem title="Votes">

```sh
$ docker run --rm -it \
    -v $(pwd)/prod-sim/desk-alice:/root/.checkers \
    --network checkers-prod_net-public \
    checkersd_i:v1-alpine \
    query gov votes 1 \
    --node "tcp://node-carol:26657"
```

</CodeGroupItem>

<CodeGroupItem title="Period">

```sh
$ docker run --rm -it \
    -v $(pwd)/prod-sim/desk-bob:/root/.checkers \
    --network checkers-prod_net-public \
    checkersd_i:v1-alpine \
    query gov proposal 1 \
    --node "tcp://node-carol:26657"
```

</CodeGroupItem>

<CodeGroupItem title="Block Height">

```sh
$ docker run --rm -it \
    --network checkers-prod_net-public \
    checkersd_i:v1-alpine status \
    --node "tcp://node-carol:26657" \
    | jq -r ".SyncInfo.latest_block_height"
```

</CodeGroupItem>

</CodeGroup>

The proposal's current status will be:

```txt
status: PROPOSAL_STATUS_VOTING_PERIOD
```

You must wait until after the proposal status changes to:

```txt
status: PROPOSAL_STATUS_PASSED
```

You must now wait longer, this time for the upgrade block to be reached.

## The live upgrade

If you are scanning the logs of one of the containers, for instance from Docker's GUI, you should see something like:

```txt
ERR UPGRADE "v1tov2" NEEDED at height: 1180:
INF starting node with ABCI Tendermint in-process
```

That was v1's last message followed by v2's first message.

After that, you should be able to query for the presence of a leaderboard:

```sh
$ docker run --rm -it \
    --network checkers-prod_net-public \
    checkersd_i:v2-alpine \
    query checkers show-leaderboard \
    --node "tcp://node-carol:26657"
```

This should return:

```yaml
Leaderboard:
  winners: []
```

An empty leaderboard, true, but it is absolutely here, which is what we were after.

## What about stop and restart?

All checkers containers are now running checkersd v2. You can see that Cosmovisor has swapped the `current` executable:

```sh
$ docker exec -it node-carol \
    ls -l /root/.checkers-upgrade/cosmovisor/current
```

This should return:

```txt
... /root/.checkers-upgrade/cosmovisor/current -> /root/.checkers-upgrade/cosmovisor/upgrade/v1tov2
```

It will return this until the containers are stopped and deleted, that is.

<HighlightBox type="warn">

Remember that the containers are loaded from a Docker image configured with Cosmovisor. In the current configuration, Cosmovisor starts with what it finds at `genesis/bin/checkersd`, i.e. v1.
<br/><br/>
All this is to say that you should not expect to stop and start your Cosmovisor Compose setup as is.

</HighlightBox>

If you were using real production servers, Cosmovisor would not reset itself on restart, so you would be safe in this regard. You would have time to revisit your server's configuration so as to launch `checkersd` v2 natively.

In this example you can prepare yet another Compose file, this time specifically for v2:

```yaml [https://github.com/cosmos/b9-checkers-academy-draft/blob/migration-prod/prod-sim/docker-compose-v2.yml]
version: "3.7"

services:

  val-alice:
    extends:
      file: docker-compose.yml
      service: val-alice
    image: checkersd_i:v2-alpine

  sentry-alice:
    extends:
      file: docker-compose.yml
      service: sentry-alice
    image: checkersd_i:v2-alpine

  val-bob:
    extends:
      file: docker-compose.yml
      service: val-bob
    image: checkersd_i:v2-alpine

  sentry-bob:
    extends:
      file: docker-compose.yml
      service: sentry-bob
    image: checkersd_i:v2-alpine

  node-carol:
    extends:
      file: docker-compose.yml
      service: node-carol
    image: checkersd_i:v2-alpine
```

Now you can safely stop the Cosmovisor setup:

```sh
$ docker compose --project-name checkers-prod down
```

And start the v2 setup:

```sh
$ docker compose \
    --file prod-sim/docker-compose.yml \
    --file prod-sim/docker-compose-v2.yml \
    --project-name checkers-prod up \
    --detach
```

If you want to test other migration configurations, for instance where Carol _forgot_ to put Cosmovisor on her node, you can revert all your blockchain files to v1 with:

```sh
$ ./prod-sim/unsafe-reset-state.sh
```
