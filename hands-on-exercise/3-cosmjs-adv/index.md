<h1 class="mt-4 mb-6">CosmJS for Your Chain</h1>

You will continue your work on CosmJS and explore how to use CosmJS and apply it to your checkers blockchain to create custom objects and messages. Further, you will discover how to give your application-specific blockchain a proper GUI and integrate CosmJS and Keplr.

The end of this chapter will deal with backend scripts and demonstrate how to use them for game indexing so that you are all set to continue developing using CosmJS.
