# Exercise - Make a Checkers Blockchain

The next sections are all about creating a decentralized game of checkers using Ignite CLI and the Cosmos SDK. Each section progressively advances the project. To learn the most efficiently, you should treat each section as _a solution_ to the questions raised at the start of the section.
