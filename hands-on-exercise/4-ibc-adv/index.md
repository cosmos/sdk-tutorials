It is time to dive deeper into IBC!

As you probably already can imagine, relayers are an important concept when dealing with inter-blockchain communication. Thus, you can have a more detailed look at relaying with IBC in the following sections. Then an introduction into IBC custom applications follows. At the end of the chapter, you can find some sections on IBC middleware elaborating on how you can create a custom IBC middleware and integrate it into your chains.
