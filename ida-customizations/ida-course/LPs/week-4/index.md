<h1 class="mt-4 mb-6">Ignite CLI and IBC Advanced</h1>

This week you'll work further on your checkers Blockchain and take your next steps with Ignite CLI. You have a workable checkers blockchain, one which lets players play. But have you thought about everything? Is your blockchain safe from bad behavior? How do you incentivize good behavior? Can you also make it more fun?

Following the hands-on exercises, you'll discover how IBC denoms work and get to grips with cross-chain tokens and relayers.
