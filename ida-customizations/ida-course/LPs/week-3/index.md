Ever wondered how cross-chain communication is possible? Get a fast introduction to the world of the **Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC)**.

You will learn more about the transportation, authentication, and ordering layer of IBC and take a deeper dive into how token transfers between chains become possible. Finally, you will take a more detailed look at relaying with IBC.

**OPTIONAL**: the sections on [IBC/TAO connections, channels, and clients](/academy/3-ibc/2-connections.md), and [interchain accounts](/academy/3-ibc/6-ica.md) are made available in case you want to dive deeper. This content **will not** be tested in the final exam.

You will also learn about CosmJS, the TypeScript library for the Cosmos SKD. With step-by-step examples, you will learn how to work with CosmJS when building your application-specific blockchain.
