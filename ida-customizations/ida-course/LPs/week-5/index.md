<h1 class="mt-4 mb-6">CosmJS Advanced</h1>

Continue your work on CosmJS and explore how to use and apply it to your checkers blockchain to create custom objects and messages. Further, you will discover how to give your application-specific blockchain a proper GUI and integrate it with CosmJS and Keplr.

The chapter also deals with backend scripts and demonstrates how to use them for game indexing, so that you are all set to continue developing using CosmJS.

* Learn how to send many transactions in a batch and into a single block.
* Explore how to introduce CosmJS into an existing checkers GUI TypeScript project, with a Keplr integration.
* Use CosmJS on a backend server to offer an indexing service and improve the user experience.
