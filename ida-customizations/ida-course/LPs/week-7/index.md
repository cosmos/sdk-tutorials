<h1 class="mt-4 mb-6">From Code to MVP to Production and Migrations</h1>

After having developed your chain, now you will take the next step to move your chain to a proof-of-concept and into production.

## In this chapter

<HighlightBox type="learning">

In this chapter, you will learn:

* About the different considerations that need to be covered before you can get your blockchain into production.
* How to compile your blockchain for distribution to interested parties.
* How to prepare, use, and protect the private cryptographic keys that you need.
* How to prepare a genesis and coordinate its creation between stakeholders.
* How to prepare your network topology and configuration to be part of your blockchain.
* How to prepare your server for convenience and reliability.
* How to apply this knowledge to simulate a small production for your checkers application with the help of Docker Compose.
* How to prepare and program a blockchain state migration (a.k.a. "a breaking change"), using the example of the introduction of a leaderboard to the checkers application.
* How to prepare your server when an upgrade is upcoming.

## Next up

It is time to move your checkers blockchain into production. In the [next section](/tutorials/9-path-to-prod/1-overview.md), you can find an overview of the different aspects one needs to address to move a Cosmos blockchain into production. Afterwards, you can dive right into preparing [your software to run](/tutorials/9-path-to-prod/2-software.md), [a validator and keys](/tutorials/9-path-to-prod/3-keys.md), [the node starting point (the genesis)](/tutorials/9-path-to-prod/5-network.md), [the nodes and their connections to other nodes](/tutorials/9-path-to-prod/6-run.md), and [migrations](/tutorials/9-path-to-prod/7-migration.md). Then you can explore [simulating production in Docker](/hands-on-exercise/4-run-in-prod/1-run-prod-docker.md).

After, you will [tally player info after production](/hands-on-exercise/4-run-in-prod/2-migration-info.md) into your checkers blockchain. Upgrading your chain in production and dealing with data migrations and logic upgrades will become easier to understand after this guided coding section.

Next, you will [add a leaderboard module](/hands-on-exercise/4-run-in-prod/3-add-leaderboard.md) and have it work elegantly with checkers, first without any migration complications.

After that, you will add another migration, this time for the introduction of the [leaderboard module in production](/hands-on-exercise/4-run-in-prod/4-migration-leaderboard.md).
