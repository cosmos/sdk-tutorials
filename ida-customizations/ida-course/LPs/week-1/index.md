<h1 class="mt-4 mb-6">Introduction to Cosmos</h1>

Enjoy an introduction to the main components of the Cosmos SDK.

From Tendermint to the modules, keepers, queries, and transactions in Cosmos, a whole universe is waiting to be discovered.

<HighlightBox type="info">

As all blockchain ecosystems keep on growing and maturing, product stacks and terminologies evolve. Thus, please be aware that Cosmos is also known as **the Interchain**. The terms "Cosmos", "Cosmos Ecosystem", and "Interchain" are synonymous with each other, and the various tools available to developers ("the stack") can be referred to collectively as the **Interchain Stack**.
