<h1 class="mt-4 mb-6">Introduction to the Interchain</h1>

Enjoy an introduction to the main components of the Cosmos SDK.

From Tendermint to the modules, keepers, queries, and transactions in the Interchain, a whole universe is waiting to be discovered.

<HighlightBox type="info">

As all blockchain ecosystems keep on growing and maturing, product stacks and terminologies evolve. Thus, please be aware that Cosmos is also known as **the Interchain**. The terms "Cosmos", "Interchain Ecosystem", and "Interchain" are synonymous with each other, and the various tools available to developers ("the stack") can be referred to collectively as the **Interchain Stack**.

**This week, make sure to submit your quiz once you feel ready to test your knowledge.**

The quiz will be available until the Final Exam is launched on July 6th.

Do not worry if you do not pass the quiz: it is simply meant to be an opportunity to practice and demonstrate your engagement with the program.

## Next up

Want to get started with the main concepts of the Cosmos SDK? Go ahead and begin with a look at [Blockchain Technology and the Interchain](/academy/1-what-is-cosmos/1-blockchain-and-cosmos.md).

But before you dive in, ask yourself: _what kind of a learner are you?_

* **Do you like to learn the theory first, then build on that foundation?** If that sounds like you, then we recommend you begin with the Week 1 content and continue through the program chronologically.
* **Do you like to get your hands dirty right away, then work back to fill in the conceptual gaps?** If this is your _modus operandi_, then we suggest you start with the Week 2 material now, then go back to read through Week 1 before you continue.

Whichever way you decide to approach the program, we **highly recommend** that you complete both Week 1 and Week 2!
