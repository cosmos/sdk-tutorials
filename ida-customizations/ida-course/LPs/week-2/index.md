<h1 class="mt-4 mb-6">First Steps</h1>

Do you want to find out how to interact with Cosmos chains? Let's take it step-by-step.

Make sure to set up your Work Environment. We have put together some useful information to get everything ready before you start.

Begin by interacting with a chain using simapp. In the end, you will know how to run a node, create blocks, and send transactions.

Then discover the first steps to building an application-specific blockchain from scratch, using Ignite to implement a checkers game and to interact with a running local blockchain from the command line.
