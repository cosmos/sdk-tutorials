<h1 class="mt-4 mb-6">Getting Started</h1>

This chapter provides an introduction to blockchain, Golang, and some of the technical terms you will encounter throughout the Academy program. 

<HighlightBox type="info">

**It is entirely optional and intended as a head start for those who might need it.**

</HighlightBox>

Do you want to refresh your blockchain knowledge? This chapter provides a general introduction to blockchain technology. Feel free to skip this chapter if you do not need a refresher and start your journey with the Week 1 content, which will be available by September 15th at 4 pm UTC when the program officially starts.

Working with Cosmos also means working with Golang. If you have not worked much with Go, do not worry.

This introduction to Golang is meant as a useful overview of Go and as such, a starting point for your journey in the Cosmos Ecosystem and developing with the Cosmos SDK.

You can also use it as a refresher.

You can find a short section at the end of the chapter with good-to-know dev terms.
