<h1 class="mt-4 mb-6">Getting Started</h1>

This chapter provides a general introduction to blockchain technology, Golang, Docker, and some of the technical terms you will encounter throughout the Academy program.

<HighlightBox type="info">

**This chapter is entirely optional and intended as a head start for those who might need it.**
<br/><br/>
If you do not need a blockchain refresher, feel free to start your journey with the Week 1 content, which will be available by May 18th at 4 pm UTC when the program officially starts.

Do you want to refresh your blockchain knowledge? This chapter provides a general introduction to blockchain technology. Feel free to skip this chapter if you do not need a refresher and start your journey with the Week 1 content, which will be available by May 18th at 4 pm UTC when the program officially starts.

Working with Cosmos also means working with Golang. If you have not worked much with Go, do not worry.

<HighlightBox type="info">

As all blockchain ecosystems keep on growing and maturing, product stacks and terminologies evolve. Thus, please be aware that Cosmos is also known as **the Interchain**. The terms "Cosmos", "Cosmos Ecosystem", and "Interchain" are synonymous with each other, and the various tools available to developers ("the stack") can be referred to collectively as the **Interchain Stack**.

</HighlightBox>

This introduction to Golang is meant as a useful overview of Go and as such, a starting point for your journey in the Cosmos Ecosystem and developing with the Cosmos SDK.

The Docker introduction will help you understand the concepts behind this tool, as you will be using Docker in the upcoming tutorials.

You can also find a short section at the end of the chapter with good-to-know dev terms.

## Next up

First, you can take a look at blockchain technology by starting with the section on [Blockchain 101](/ida-course/0-blockchain-basics/1-blockchain.md). <!-- markdown-link-check-disable-line -->

Then, for a quick overview on Golang, begin with the section [Go Introduction - First Steps](/tutorials/4-golang-intro/1-install.md).

In case you want to take a look at some technical terms, go ahead and visit the section [Good-To-Know Dev Terms](/tutorials/1-tech-terms/index.md).

Finally, so you are ready for the hands-on-exercises, consult the [introduction to Docker](/tutorials/5-docker-intro/index.md).
