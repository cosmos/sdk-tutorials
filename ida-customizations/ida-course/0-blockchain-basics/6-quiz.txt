>> 1. How do you define blockchain? Which of the following statements are correct?<<
[x] As the ordered list of all transactions since inception.
[x] As a well-ordered set of blocks.
[ ] As a block of transactions.
[x] As a well-ordered set of data, on which all peers eventually agree.
[ ] As a shared real-time transaction network.

>> 2. In the context of blockchain, what is the most fundamental definition of a transaction?<<
( ) Transmission of a message between nodes.
(x) An atomic event that is allowed by the underlying protocol.
( ) Exchange of a hash table between two peers.

>> 3. Choose all applicable properties of a Hash.<<
[x] A hash is deterministic, in that calculating it twice yields the same result.
[ ] A small change in the original value yields a smaller change in the hash than a big change in the original value.
[x] The probability of finding two different values that compute to the same hash is extremely low.

>> 4. Which of the following statements about the basic problem blockchain is attempting to solve is true?<<
( ) Blockchain technology merges internet and network.
(x) Blockchain technology merges database and network.
( ) Blockchain technology merges smart contracts and network.
( ) Blockchain technology merges future and network.

>> 5. Alice wants to send a message to Bob, which is for Bob's eyes only. What is the right way to encrypt and decrypt?<<
(x) Bob gives Alice his public key - Alice uses Bob's public key to encrypt the message - Alice sends Bob the encrypted message - Bob decrypts the message with his private key.
( ) Bob gives Alice his private key - Alice uses Bob’s private key to encrypt the message - Alice sends Bob the encrypted message - Bob decrypts the message with his public key.

>> 6. What is the double-spend problem within Bitcoin?<<
( ) The attacker sends two different transactions at the same time to the network, to send the same coin to two different recipients before the nodes can spot the fraud.
(x) The attacker sends the coin to a recipient in exchange for a consideration, waits to receive the consideration, then builds a fork that does not contain the previous transaction and that is acceptable to the network.
( ) The attacker sends the coin to a recipient in exchange for a consideration, waits to receive the consideration, then sends another transaction to cancel the first transaction.

[explanation]
Here we assumed the recipient waits for the transaction to be mined. If the recipient did not wait for the mining to take place, and instead took an un-mined transaction as confirmation, this recipient would expose itself to a <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Double-spending#Race_attack">race attack</a>.
[explanation]

>> 7. As a non-hierarchical approach, how does Blockchain overcome the potential failures of a “classical” network?<<
(x) By making sure that every participant always has access to enough data to verify the integrity of ALL data in the network.
( ) By encrypting ALL data in the network.
( ) By using certificates for all participants in the network, thus excluding malicious participants from the network.
