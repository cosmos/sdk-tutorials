Please post your question in the channel that fits best. This will allow you and the support team to keep track of your question. The channels correspond to the main topics covered in the Academy content. You will find a description of each channel on Discord.

## How to ask a question

You can post a message with your question directly into any channel.

Make sure you mark your message as a question by adding the question emoticon (?) to it. This will create a new support ticket.

Once a ticket has been created, tutors and expert instructors are informed about the new question and can reply directly to your original post. You will also receive a DM from _Trisha | Support Bot_, our suppor tbot, which confirms that a ticket has been opened.

After your question has been answered, the ticket can be closed by you, the tutor, or the assigned expert instructor. React with the exclamation mark emoji (!) on your message to close the ticket.

If you still have a follow-up question after the ticket was closed, you can post a new message in the channel and open a new ticket.

## Reply by tutors and expert instructors

Your tutors and expert instructors will be notified about your request and will come back to you to help you to answer your question or solve an issue.

## Auto replies

When you mark a message as a question, _Tricia_ might reply with one or more responses or 'Auto Replies'. When she asks you 'Does this answer your question?', please respond with yes or no to indicate whether you need more support.
