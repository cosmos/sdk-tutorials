# Hey There,

Thank you for taking the final exam for the Interchain Developer Academy. Unfortunately, you didn't pass the exam.

**However, given how far you've come, we'd like to invite you to join the next cohort of the Academy. The program starts on 1st of December.**

You won't need to do the screening test, take the quizzes, or complete any exercises apart from the final exam.

You'll have access to all the updated materials, the Discord channels, and support, and you'll be able to take the exam again (the exam period of the 3rd cohort is from 2nd of February 2023 to 2nd of March 2023).

All the best,

_Noam and the Interchain Developer Academy Team_

_PS: if you know developers who are interested in exploring Cosmos, please share the link to the next cohort of the Academy with them: [academy.cosmos.network](https://academy.cosmos.network/)_.
