# Hey There

Congratulations! You passed the Interchain Developer Academy final exam with flying colors. Well done on making it this far!

We’ve got two important emails coming your way over the next several days:

1. Your well-earned Interchain Developer Academy **Badge** to certify you’ve completed the Academy. You can download or share this as a link on any page including your social profiles. 
2. Your access to the Cosmos **Jobs Board**! It will include all the open roles in the ecosystem so it’s a great place to start exploring your next steps into the ecosystem.

I want to thank you for dedicating the time to join the Interchain Developer Academy. It’s been a pleasure having you on the program and I look forward to hearing about your next steps into the Cosmos ecosystem.


All the best,

_Noam and the Interchain Developer Academy Team_

_PS: if you know developers who are interested in exploring Cosmos, please share the link to the next cohort of the Academy with them: [academy.cosmos.network](https://academy.cosmos.network/)_
