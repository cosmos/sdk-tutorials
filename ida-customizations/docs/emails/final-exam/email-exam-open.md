# Hey There!

**Great news! The exam is unlocked!**

Accessing the exam is a simple process:

Check your email (and spam folder) for an invitation to the [B9lab academy gitlab server](https://git.academy.b9lab.com/). The email contains a link to setup your password. Follow this link to finish your account creation and log into the gitlab server.

Once you are in you will see three repositories:

1. `IDA-P2-final-exam/student-projects/YourName-exam-code`. This is your repository for the coding part of the exam. You are its maintainer. Its content has been forked from `exam-code`.
2. `IDA-P2-final-exam/exam-code`. It is read-only and is the _upstream_ of your repository.
3. `IDA-P2-final-exam/exam-ibc-operation`. It is read-only and details the IBC operation part of the exam.

[This page](https://interchainacademy.cosmos.network/ida-course/final-exam/index.html) on the academy gives more details about both parts of the exam.

To complete the IBC operations exercise, you need **two values** that are **unique to you**. The details of what and why should become clear after you read the [exercise description](https://git.academy.b9lab.com/ida-p2-final-exam/exam-ibc-operation/-/blob/main/exercise-description.md). You can find these unique values only in this email, or, if you lost the email, if you DM us on Discord. They are:

1. Recipient address: **<!StudentInfo.addressRecipient>**.
2. Origin denomination: **<!StudentInfo.homeDenom>**.

Tips!

For each exercise, we recommend you read the readme in full before hacking away.

The two parts are independent and you can tackle them in any order.

[End of Tip box]

You can work on your exam until the 22nd of July and can submit your exam whenever you feel ready. Importantly, **22nd of July is a hard cut-off, we are not granting extensions**.

We are providing reduced support on Discord during the exam period. However, we are always happy to help, so reach out if you have questions and issues. It may take us longer to get back to you. As always, we do not provide support on the weekends.

You will get your results by the 3rd of August.

Good luck with your exam!

Noam and the Interchain Developer Academy Team.
