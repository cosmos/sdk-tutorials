        Academy start: December 1st<br/><br/>
        Program duration: December 1st, 2022 till February 2nd, 2023 (seven weeks, including a two-week holiday period from December 22nd till January 5th)<br/><br/>
        Exam period: February 2nd, 2023 to March 2nd, 2023<br/><br/>

    - title: What you will learn
      description: |
        Over the next nine weeks (7+2), you will dive deep into the Cosmos Ecosystem, starting with a high-level introduction to familiarize yourself with the main concepts. Next, you will put theory into practice by learning how to initiate and build an application-specific blockchain using the Cosmos SDK; how to use the Ignite CLI to scaffold modules for your blockchain; and how to connect a chain with other chains using the Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC). You will learn how to build frontend and backend applications using CosmJS; operate nodes and validate on a Cosmos blockchain; and run a relaying infrastructure between IBC-connected chains.
    - title: How to get the most out of the Academy
      description: |
          The Academy is self-paced and flexible, so you do not have to be online at particular times. You can follow the weekly plan or go through the learning material at your own pace. We recommend allocating about 10 to 15 hours a week to get through all the material.<br/><br/>
          We will offer some live sessions with Cosmos experts about various topics. These live sessions will be announced via email and discord. The sessions will be recorded in case you cannot join them live.<br/><br/>
          The material is delivered in various formats, including text, images, videos, quizzes, and exercises. There is plenty of additional material embedded in the content to deepen your understanding of particular concepts. And if you want even more, ask your tutors and expert instructors, who will point you in the right direction!<br/><br/>
          <b>Hands-on exercises</b><br/><br/>
          In each module, you will find quizzes and/or code exercises. In the first two weeks, you can submit a quiz (end of Week 1) and an exercise (end of Week 2). It does not matter if you pass a quiz or exercise - think of these as opportunities to practice and demonstrate your engagement with the program.<br/><br/>
          Week 1: Quiz - due date: Thursday, December 8th<br/><br/>
          Week 2: Exercise - due date: Thursday, December 15th<br/><br/>
          You will get the results of submitted exercises.<br/><br/>
          <b>Technical requirements</b><br/><br/>
          No special technical requirements of HW or SW are needed. You need a computer with at least 8 GB RAM and 4 GB free hard disk space.
    - title: How much time do I need to dedicate to the Academy?
      description: |
        There are roughly 80 hours of learning material and exercises to work through. In addition, you need to plan for about 20 hours to complete the final exam. In our experience, participants who allocate about 10 to 15 hours of work per week tend to get the most out of the program and perform best. However, learning styles are different, so work at a pace that suits you!<br/><br/>
        All the materials are available right from the start of the program.
    - title: What support will I get in the Academy? 
      description: |
        We have set up a private Discord for the Academy for all teaching and ongoing communication. You can reach out to your tutors and expert instructors anytime for support. We encourage you to proactively collaborate with other participants in your cohort and with your instructors. Ask questions, request feedback, and seek help if you are stuck! That way, you will get the most out of the Academy.<br/><br/>
        We aim to answer your questions within a few hours. Our maximum response time is 24 hours. Main support hours are on weekdays between 6 AM UTC and 4 PM UTC. We do not provide support during the weekends.<br/><br/>
        Click <a href="/ida-course/discord-info.html">here</a> to learn how to join and use Discord.<br/><br/>
        You will get detailed information on how to join and use Discord via email.
    - title: How do I access Discord?
      description: |
        Follow these two steps to join the private Academy channels on Discord:<br/><br/>
        Join the official Cosmos Discord by clicking [here](https://discord.gg/cosmosnetwork). Follow the verification process. It is straightforward, but if you need guidance read <a href="https://medium.com/@alicemeowuk/cosmos-developers-discord-access-7c15951cc839"</a>.<br/><br/>
        After joining the Discord server, go <a href="https://academy.cosmos.network/onboarding/?token=%7B$b9_uuid%7D">here</a> and enter your Discord ID. You will automatically be added to the Discord area for participants called "Interchain Developer Academy".<br/><br/>
        If you have any problems, email us at <a href="academy@interchain.io">academy@interchain.io</a>.<br/>
        We have put together a <a href="https://interchainacademy.cosmos.network/ida-course/discord-info.html">quick guide</a> explaining how to best communicate on Discord.
    - title: How do I get certified?
      description: |
        After the seven-week program (7+2 weeks due to holiday break), you will have four weeks to complete an exam - a combination of quizzes and a code project. The exam will be open from <b>February 2nd, 2023</b> and you have to complete it by <b>March 2nd, 2023</b>.<br/><br/>
        You will receive an email and notification via Discord closer to the date.<br/><br/>
        If you complete the program earlier you can take the exam sooner. The earliest you can take the exam is from the fourth week of the program.<br/><br/>
        You will receive an email with further instructions on how to launch the exam request.<br/><br/>
        The exam is an individual exercise.<br/><br/>
        <div class="tm-bold">When do I get the results?</div>
        You will receive your exam results by <span class="tm-bold">March 16th</span>.

These tutorials guide you through actionable steps and walk-throughs to teach you how to use Ignite CLI and the Cosmos SDK. The Cosmos SDK is the world’s most popular framework for building application-specific blockchains. Tutorials provide step-by-step instructions to help you build foundational knowledge and learn how to use Ignite CLI and the Cosmos SDK, including:

* Foundational knowledge to help you navigate between blockchains with the Cosmos SDK
* Learn how Ignite CLI works
* Create a blockchain polling application
* Build an exchange that works with two or more blockchains
* Interact with the Cosmos Hub Testnet to test the functionality of your blockchain
* Use the liquidity module, known on the Cosmos Hub as Gravity DEX, to create liquidity pools so users can swap tokens
* Publish your blockchain application to a Droplet on DigitalOcean
* Connect to a testnet
* Design, build, and run an app as a scavenger hunt game
