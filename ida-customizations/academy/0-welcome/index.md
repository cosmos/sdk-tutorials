        Detailed information on how to join the sessions will be provided via email and Discord.
        You should receive an email with a link to each session to be added to your calendar. We will post the session links on the day of the session on discord. Do not worry if you cannot make it to the session, we will record and publish them in the Academy.
    - title: What you will learn
      description: |
        Over the next seven weeks, you will dive deep into the Cosmos Ecosystem, starting with a high-level introduction to familiarize yourself with the main concepts. Next, you will put theory into practice by learning how to initiate and build an application-specific blockchain using the Cosmos SDK; how to use the Ignite CLI to scaffold modules for your blockchain; and how to connect a chain with other chains using the Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol. You will learn how to build frontend and backend applications using CosmJS, operate nodes and validate on a Cosmos blockchain, and run a relaying infrastructure between IBC-connected chains.
    - title: How to get the most out of the Academy
      description: |
          The Academy is self-paced and flexible, so you do not have to be online at particular times. You can follow the weekly plan or go through the learning material at your own pace. We recommend allocating about 10 hours a week to get through all the material.<br/><br/>
          We will offer some live sessions with Cosmos experts about various topics. These live sessions will be announced via email and discord. The sessions will be recorded in case you cannot join them live.<br/><br/>
          The material is delivered in various formats, including text, images, videos, quizzes, and exercises. There is plenty of additional material embedded in the content to deepen your understanding of particular concepts. And if you want even more, ask your tutors and expert instructors, who will point you in the right direction!<br/><br/>
          <b>Mandatory exercises</b><br/><br/>
          In each module, you will find quizzes and/or code exercises. Two of these need to be completed by a certain date. It does not matter if you pass a quiz or exercise - think of these as opportunities to practice and demonstrate your engagement with the program.<br/><br/>
          Week 1: Mandatory quiz - due date: Friday, September 23rd<br/><br/>
          Week 2: Mandatory exercise - due date: Friday, September 30th<br/><br/>
          You will also find exercises every week that are not mandatory. These are still highly recommended, as they are a good preparation for the final exam.<br/><br/>
          <b>Technical requirements</b><br/><br/>
          No special technical requirements of HW or SW are needed. You need a computer with at least 8 GB RAM and 4 GB free hard disk space.
    - title: How much time do I need to dedicate to the Academy?
      description: |
        There are roughly 70 hours of learning material and exercises to work through. In addition, you need to plan for about 20 hours to complete the final exam. In our experience, participants who allocate about 10 hours of work per week tend to get the most out of the program and perform best. However, learning styles are different, so work at a pace that suits you!<br/><br/>
        All the materials are available right from the start of the program.
    - title: What support will I get in the Academy? 
      description: |
        We have set up a private Discord for the Academy for all teaching and ongoing communication. You can reach out to your tutors and expert instructors anytime for support. We encourage you to proactively collaborate with other participants in your cohort and with your instructors. Ask questions, request feedback, and seek help if you are stuck! That way, you will get the most out of the Academy.<br/><br/>
        We aim to answer your questions within a few hours. Our maximum response time is 24 hours. Main support hours are on weekdays between 6 AM UTC and 4 PM UTC. We do not provide support during the weekends.<br/><br/>
        Click <a href="/ida-course/discord-info.html">here</a> to learn how to join and use Discord.<br/><br/>
        You will get detailed information on how to join and use Discord via email.
    - title: How do I access Discord?
      description: |
        Follow these two steps to join the private Academy channels on Discord:<br/><br/>
        1. Join the official Cosmos Discord by clicking <a href="https://discord.gg/cosmosnetwork">here</a>.<br/><br/>
        2. Follow the verification process. It is straightforward but if you need guidance, read <a href="https://medium.com/@alicemeowuk/cosmos-developers-discord-access-7c15951cc839">this article</a>.<br/><br/>
        3. After joining the Discord server, go to <a href="">LINK</a> and enter your Discord ID. You will automatically be added to the Discord area for participants called "Interchain Developer Academy".<br/><br/>
        If you have any problems, email us at <a href="mailto:academy@interchain.io">academy@interchain.io</a>.<br/><br/>
        We have put together a <a href="/ida-course/discord-info.html">quick guide</a> explaining how to best communicate on Discord.
    - title: How do I get certified?
      description: |
        After the seven-week program, you will have two weeks to complete an exam - a combination of quizzes and a code project. The exam will be open from <b>November 3rd</b> and you have to complete it by <b>December 1st</b>.<br/><br/>
        You will receive an email and notification via Discord closer to the date.<br/><br/>
        If you complete the program earlier you can take the exam sooner. The earliest you can take the exam is from the fourth week of the program.<br/><br/>
        You will receive an email with further instructions on how to launch the exam request.<br/><br/>
        The exam is an individual exercise.<br/><br/>
        <div class="tm-bold">When do I get the results?</div>
        You will receive your exam results by <span class="tm-bold">December 15th</span>.
