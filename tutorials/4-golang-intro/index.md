Working with Cosmos also often means working with Golang. If you have not worked much with Go, do not worry.

This introduction to Golang is meant as a useful overview of Go and as such, a starting point for your journey in the Cosmos Ecosystem and developing with the Cosmos SDK.

You can also use it as a refresher if you feel a bit rusty when it comes to Go.
