# Ignite CLI

<HighlightBox type="synopsis">

Before diving into the details of how Ignite CLI helps you scaffold the basics for your application blockchain make sure to understand the main concepts presented in the following sections:

* [A Blockchain App Architecture](../2-main-concepts/architecture.md)
* [Accounts](../2-main-concepts/accounts.md)
* [Transactions](../2-main-concepts/transactions.md)
* [Messages](../2-main-concepts/messages.md)
* [Modules](../2-main-concepts/modules.md)
* [Protobuf](../2-main-concepts/protobuf.md)
* [BaseApp](../2-main-concepts/base-app.md)

You can follow a hands-on exercise for Ignite CLI in the sections that follow this introduction.

</HighlightBox>

The Cosmos SDK provides the building blocks for a complete Tendermint blockchain, which implements the Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC). The _BaseApp_ of the Cosmos SDK assembles these building blocks and provides a fully-running blockchain. All there is left to do for the specific blockchain application is to create specific modules and integrate them with BaseApp to make the application _your own_.

Ignite CLI assists with scaffolding modules and integrating them with BaseApp. Ignite CLI is a command-line tool that writes code files and updates them when instructed to do so. If you come from an _on Rails_ world, the concept will look familiar to you.

On top of that Ignite CLI will handle some compilation, run a local blockchain node, and help you with other tasks.

## Install

<HighlightBox type="tip">

Want to dedicate some time to dive deeper into installing Ignite CLI? Learn [how to install Ignite CLI in the Ignite CLI Developer Guide](https://docs.ignite.com/guide/install.html).

</HighlightBox>

To install Ignite CLI at the command line:

```sh
$ curl https://get.ignite.com/cli! | bash
```

You can verify the version of Ignite CLI you have once it is installed:

```sh
$ ignite version

Ignite CLI version:	v0.17.3
...
```

<HighlightBox type="info">

This entire exercise was built using the Ignite CLI version noted above. Using a newer version could work, but you might run into compatibility issues if you clone any code made with _this_ version of Ignite CLI and then try to continue the project with _your_ version of Ignite CLI.

To install this specific version of Ignite CLI, use:

```sh
curl https://get.ignite.com/cli@v0.17.0! | bash
```

If you'd like to upgrade an existing project to the latest version of Ignite CLI, you can follow the [Ignite CLI migration documentation](https://docs.ignite.com/migration/).


</HighlightBox>

You can also just type `ignite` to see the offered commands:

```sh
Ignite CLI is a tool for creating sovereign blockchains built with Cosmos SDK, the world‚Äôs
most popular modular blockchain framework. Ignite CLI offers everything you need to scaffold,
test, build, and launch your blockchain.

To get started create a blockchain:

ignite scaffold chain github.com/cosmonaut/mars

Usage:
  ignite [command]

Available Commands:
  scaffold    Scaffold a new blockchain, module, message, query, and more
  chain       Build, initialize and start a blockchain node or perform other actions on the blockchain
  generate    Generate clients, API docs from source code
  network     Launch a blockchain network in production
  relayer     Connects blockchains via IBC protocol
  tools       Tools for advanced users
  docs        Show Ignite CLI docs
  version     Print the current build information
  help        Help about any command

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for ignite

Use "ignite [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```


## Your chain

Start by scaffolding a basic chain called `checkers` that you will place under the GitHub path `alice` with:

```sh
$ ignite scaffold chain github.com/alice/checkers
```

The scaffolding takes some time as it generates the source code for a fully functional ready-to-use blockchain. Ignite CLI creates a folder named `checkers` and scaffolds the chain inside it.

The `checkers` folder contains several generated files and directories that make up the structure of a Cosmos SDK blockchain. It contains the following folders:

* `app`: a folder for the application.
* `cmd`: a folder for the command-line interface commands.
* `proto`: a folder for the Protobuf objects definitions.
* `vue`: a folder for the UI.
* `x`: a folder for all your own modules, in particular `checkers`.

<HighlightBox type="tip">

If Vue.js is something new to you, check out the [Vue.js website](https://vuejs.org/) for more on this JavaScript framework.

</HighlightBox>

If you look at the code that Ignite CLI generates, for instance in `./x/checkers/module.go`, you will often see comments like the following:

```go
// this line is used by starport scaffolding # 1
```

**Caution:** Do not remove or replace any lines like these in your code as they provide markers for Ignite CLI on where to add further code when instructed to do so. For the same reason, do not rename or move any file that contains such a line.

Go to the `checkers` folder and run:

```sh
$ cd checkers
$ ignite chain serve
```

The `ignite chain serve` command downloads dependencies and compiles the source code into a binary called `checkersd`. The command:

* Installs all dependencies.
* Builds Protobuf files.
* Compiles the application.
* Initializes the node with a single validator.
* Adds accounts.

After this command completes, you have a local testnet with a running node. What about the added accounts? Take a look at:

<CodeGroup>

<CodeGroupItem title="config.yml" active>

```yaml
accounts:
  - name: alice
    coins: ["20000token", "200000000stake"]
  - name: bob
    coins: ["10000token", "100000000stake"]
validator:
  name: alice
  staked: "100000000stake"
client:
  vuex:
    path: "vue/src/store"
  openapi:
    path: "docs/static/openapi.yml"
faucet:
  name: bob
  coins: ["5token", "100000stake"]
```

</CodeGroupItem>

</CodeGroup>

In this file, you can set the accounts, the accounts' starting balances, and the validator. You can also let Ignite CLI generate a client and a faucet. The faucet gives away five `token` and 100,000 `stake` tokens belonging to Bob each time it is called.

You can observe the endpoints of the blockchain in the output of the `ignite chain serve` command:

```sh
üåç Tendermint node: http://0.0.0.0:26657
üåç Blockchain API: http://0.0.0.0:1317
üåç Token faucet: http://0.0.0.0:4500
```

Ignite CLI can detect any change to the source code. When it does, it immediately rebuilds the binaries before restarting the blockchain and keeping the state.

## Your GUI

Now boot up the frontend created by Ignite CLI by using the commands provided in the `readme.md` file of the `checkers` folder. For this you let the chain run in its own process and open a new terminal window in your `checkers` folder. In this terminal execute:

```sh
$ cd vue
$ npm install
$ npm run serve
```

Navigate to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/). On the client side no wallets have been created or imported yet. Load Alice's wallet in the GUI to have some tokens. You will need to use the mnemonic for Alice which you can find in the output of the `ignite chain serve` command. Copy and paste it to _import a wallet_.

Now you should see the balance of Alice's account and can act on her behalf.

Select **Custom Type** in the sidebar to see custom types. There are no custom types yet, this page is empty for now.

<HighlightBox type="tip">

It is **good practice** to make a Git commit before you create a new `message`. In fact, it is generally recommended to make a Git commit before running **any** `ignite scaffold` command. A Git commit protects the work you have done so far and makes it easier to see what the `scaffold` command added. It also makes it easy to just revert all changes if you are unsatisfied and want to run a different `scaffold` command.

</HighlightBox>

## Your first message

With your Git commit tucked away, now create a simple `message` with:

```sh
$ ignite scaffold message createPost title body
```

The `ignite scaffold message` command accepts a message name, here `createPost`, as the first argument, and a list of fields for the message, here `title` and `body`, which are `string`s unless mentioned otherwise.

A message is scaffolded in a module with a name that matches the name of the project by default. It is named `checkers` in this case. Or you could have used `--module checkers`. Learn more about your options with:

```sh
$ ignite scaffold message --help
```

You can see a list of files that were created or modified by the `scaffold message` command in the Terminal output:

```sh
modify proto/checkers/tx.proto
modify x/checkers/client/cli/tx.go
create x/checkers/client/cli/tx_create_post.go
modify x/checkers/handler.go
create x/checkers/keeper/msg_server_create_post.go
modify x/checkers/types/codec.go
create x/checkers/types/message_create_post.go
```

The `modify` was made possible thanks to the lines like `// this line is used by starport scaffolding # 1` that you did not remove. So where is everything? You can find the root definition of your new message in:

<CodeGroup>

<CodeGroupItem title="proto/checkers/tx.proto" active>

```protobuf
// this line is used by starport scaffolding # proto/tx/message
message MsgCreatePost {
  string creator = 1;
  string title = 2;
  string body = 3;
}
```

</CodeGroupItem>

</CodeGroup>

Ignite CLI also wired a new command into your chain's CLI in:

<CodeGroup>

<CodeGroupItem title="x/checkers/client/cli/tx_create_post.go" active>

```go
func CmdCreatePost() *cobra.Command {
  cmd := &cobra.Command{
    Use:   "create-post [title] [body]",
    Short: "Broadcast message createPost",
    Args:  cobra.ExactArgs(2),
    ...
  }
}
```

</CodeGroupItem>

</CodeGroup>

Ignite CLI scaffolded GUI elements relating to your message with a Vue.js frontend framework. You can, for instance, start with this function in:

<CodeGroup>

<CodeGroupItem title="vue/src/store/generated/alice/checkers/alice.checkers.checkers/index.ts" active>

```typescript
async MsgCreatePost({ rootGetters }, { value }) {
    try {
        const txClient=await initTxClient(rootGetters)
        const msg = await txClient.msgCreatePost(value)
        return msg
    } catch (e) {
        if (e == MissingWalletError) {
            throw new SpVuexError('TxClient:MsgCreatePost:Init', 'Could not initialize signing client. Wallet is required.')
        }else{
            throw new SpVuexError('TxClient:MsgCreatePost:Create', 'Could not create message: ' + e.message)

        }
    }
},
```

</CodeGroupItem>

<CodeGroupItem title="index.js">

```javascript
async MsgCreatePost({ rootGetters }, { value }) {
    try {
        const txClient = await initTxClient(rootGetters);
        const msg = await txClient.msgCreatePost(value);
        return msg;
    }
    catch (e) {
        if (e == MissingWalletError) {
            throw new SpVuexError('TxClient:MsgCreatePost:Init', 'Could not initialize signing client. Wallet is required.');
        }
        else {
            throw new SpVuexError('TxClient:MsgCreatePost:Create', 'Could not create message: ' + e.message);
        }
    }
}
```

</CodeGroupItem>

</CodeGroup>

## Next up

You just created a fully working Cosmos SDK chain, one that forms the basis of the [following exercise](./stored-game.md).

<HighlightBox type="info">

You can remove the `MsgCreatePost` message as it is not part of the guided exercise in the next sections. You can clean it all by running:

```sh
$ git checkout -f && git clean -fd
```
