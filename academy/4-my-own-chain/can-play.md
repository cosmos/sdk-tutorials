# Query - Help Find a Correct Move

<HighlightBox type="synopsis">

Make sure you have all you need before proceeding:

* You understand the concepts of [queries](../2-main-concepts/queries.md) and [Protobuf](../2-main-concepts/protobuf.md).
* You have Go installed.
* You have the checkers blockchain codebase up to gas metering. If not, follow the [previous steps](./gas-meter.md) or check out [the relevant version](https://github.com/cosmos/b9-checkers-academy-draft/tree/gas-meter).

</HighlightBox>

A player sends a `MsgPlayMove` when [making a move](./play-game.md). This message can succeed or fail for several reasons. One error situation is when the message represents an invalid move.

Players should be able to make sure that a move is valid before burning gas. To add this functionality, you need to create a way for the player to call the [`Move`](https://github.com/batkinson/checkers-go/blob/a09daeb/checkers/checkers.go#L274) function without changing the game's state. You use a query to achieve this, because they are evaluated in memory and do not commit anything permanently to storage.

## New information

To run a query to check the validity of a move you need to pass:

* The game ID: call the field `IdValue`.
* The `player`, as queries do not have a signer.
* The origin board position: `fromX` and `fromY`.
* The target board position: `toX` and `toY`.

The information to be returned is:

* A boolean for whether the move is valid, called `Possible`.
* A text which explains why the move is not valid, called `Reason`.

As with other data structures, you can create the query message object with Ignite CLI:

```sh
$ ignite scaffold query canPlayMove idValue player fromX:uint fromY:uint toX:uint toY:uint --module checkers --response possible:bool,reason
```

Among other files, you should now have this:

```protobuf [https://github.com/cosmos/b9-checkers-academy-draft/blob/0f56961/proto/checkers/query.proto#L39-L51]
message QueryCanPlayMoveRequest {
    string idValue = 1;
    string player = 2;
    uint64 fromX = 3;
    uint64 fromY = 4;
    uint64 toX = 5;
    uint64 toY = 6;
 }

 message QueryCanPlayMoveResponse {
    bool possible = 1;
    string reason = 2;
}
```

Ignite CLI has created the following boilerplate for you:

* The [Protobuf gRPC interface function](https://github.com/cosmos/b9-checkers-academy-draft/blob/0f56961/proto/checkers/query.proto#L17-L19) to submit your new `QueryCanPlayMoveRequest` and its default implementation.
* The [routing of this new query](https://github.com/cosmos/b9-checkers-academy-draft/blob/0f56961/x/checkers/types/query.pb.gw.go#L319-L337) in the query facilities.
* An [empty function](https://github.com/cosmos/b9-checkers-academy-draft/blob/92864a4/x/checkers/keeper/grpc_query_can_play_move.go#L19) ready to implement the action.

## Query handling

Now you need to implement the answer to the player's query in `grpc_query_can_play_move.go`. Differentiate between two types of errors:

* Errors relating to the move, returning a reason.
* Errors if a move test is impossible, returning an error.

1. The game needs to be fetched. If it does not exist at all, you can return an error message because you did not test the move:

    ```go [https://github.com/cosmos/b9-checkers-academy-draft/blob/0f56961/x/checkers/keeper/grpc_query_can_play_move.go#L23-L26]
    storedGame, found := k.GetStoredGame(ctx, req.IdValue)
    if !found {
        return nil, sdkerrors.Wrapf(types.ErrGameNotFound, types.ErrGameNotFound.Error(), req.IdValue)
    }
    ```

2. Has the game already been won?

    ```go [https://github.com/cosmos/b9-checkers-academy-draft/blob/0f56961/x/checkers/keeper/grpc_query_can_play_move.go#L29-L34]
    if storedGame.Winner != rules.NO_PLAYER.Color {
        return &types.QueryCanPlayMoveResponse{
            Possible: false,
            Reason:   types.ErrGameFinished.Error(),
        }, nil
    }
    ```

3. Is the `player` given a valid player?

    ```go [https://github.com/cosmos/b9-checkers-academy-draft/blob/0f56961/x/checkers/keeper/grpc_query_can_play_move.go#L37-L47]
    var player rules.Player
    if strings.Compare(rules.RED_PLAYER.Color, req.Player) == 0 {
        player = rules.RED_PLAYER
    } else if strings.Compare(rules.BLACK_PLAYER.Color, req.Player) == 0 {
        player = rules.BLACK_PLAYER
    } else {
        return &types.QueryCanPlayMoveResponse{
            Possible: false,
            Reason:   fmt.Sprintf(types.ErrCreatorNotPlayer.Error(), req.Player),
        }, nil
    }
    ```

4. Is it the player's turn?

    ```go [https://github.com/cosmos/b9-checkers-academy-draft/blob/0f56961/x/checkers/keeper/grpc_query_can_play_move.go#L50-L59]
    game, err := storedGame.ParseGame()
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    if !game.TurnIs(player) {
        return &types.QueryCanPlayMoveResponse{
            Possible: false,
            Reason:   fmt.Sprintf(types.ErrNotPlayerTurn.Error(), player.Color),
        }, nil
    }
    ```

5. Attempt the move and report back:

    ```go [https://github.com/cosmos/b9-checkers-academy-draft/blob/0f56961/x/checkers/keeper/grpc_query_can_play_move.go#L62-L77]
    _, moveErr := game.Move(
        rules.Pos{
            X: int(req.FromX),
            Y: int(req.FromY),
        },
        rules.Pos{
            X: int(req.ToX),
            Y: int(req.ToY),
        },
    )
    if moveErr != nil {
        return &types.QueryCanPlayMoveResponse{
            Possible: false,
            Reason:   fmt.Sprintf(types.ErrWrongMove.Error(), moveErr.Error()),
        }, nil
    }
    ```

6. If all went well:

    ```go [https://github.com/cosmos/b9-checkers-academy-draft/blob/0f56961/x/checkers/keeper/grpc_query_can_play_move.go#L79-L82]
    return &types.QueryCanPlayMoveResponse{
        Possible: true,
        Reason:   "ok",
    }, nil
    ```

## Integration tests



## Interact via the CLI

A friendly reminder that the CLI can always inform you about available commands:

<CodeGroup>
<CodeGroupItem title="Checkers" active>

```sh
$ checkersd query checkers --help
```

Which prints:

```
...
Available Commands:
  can-play-move    Query canPlayMove
...
```

</CodeGroupItem>
<CodeGroupItem title="Can play move">

```sh
$ checkersd query checkers can-play-move --help
```

Which prints:

```
...
Usage:
  checkersd query checkers can-play-move [idValue] [player] [fromX] [fromY] [toX] [toY] [flags]
...
```

</CodeGroupItem>
</CodeGroup>

---

You can test this query at any point in a game's life.

<CodeGroup>
<CodeGroupItem title="No game" active>

```sh
$ checkersd query checkers can-play-move 2048 red 1 2 2 3
```

Trying this on a game that does not exist returns:

```
Error: rpc error: code = InvalidArgument desc = game by id not found: 2048: game by id not found: %s: invalid request
...
```

Confirm this was an error from the point of view of the executable:

```sh
$ echo $?
```

This prints:

```
1
```

There is room to improve the error message, but it is important that you got an error, as expected.

</CodeGroupItem>
<CodeGroupItem title="Bad color">

```sh
$ checkersd tx checkers create-game $alice $bob 1000000 --from $alice -y
$ checkersd query checkers can-play-move 0 white 1 2 2 3
```

If the player tries to play the wrong color on a game that exists, it returns:

```
possible: false
reason: 'message creator is not a player: white'
```

This is a proper message response, and a reason elaborating on the message.

</CodeGroupItem>
<CodeGroupItem title="Wrong turn">

```sh
$ checkersd query checkers can-play-move 0 red 0 5 1 4
```

If the opponent tries to play out of turn, it returns:

```
possible: false
reason: 'player tried to play out of turn: red'
```

</CodeGroupItem>
<CodeGroupItem title="Not your piece">

```sh
$ checkersd query checkers can-play-move 0 black 0 5 1 4
```

If black tries to play a red piece, it returns:

```
possible: false
reason: wrong move%!(EXTRA string=Not {red}s turn)
```

</CodeGroupItem>
<CodeGroupItem title="Correct">

```sh
$ checkersd query checkers can-play-move 0 black 1 2 2 3
```

If black tests a correct move, it returns:

```
possible: true
reason: ok
```

</CodeGroupItem>
<CodeGroupItem title="Must capture">

```sh
$ checkersd tx checkers play-move 0 1 2 2 3 --from $bob -y
$ checkersd tx checkers play-move 0 0 5 1 4 --from $alice -y
$ checkersd query checkers can-play-move 0 black 2 3 3 4
```

If black fails to capture a mandatory red piece, it returns:

```
possible: false
reason: 'wrong move%!(EXTRA string=Invalid move: {2 3} to {3 4})'
```

The reason given is understandable, but it does not clarify why the move is invalid. There is room to improve this message.

</CodeGroupItem>
<CodeGroupItem title="After forfeit">

```sh
$ checkersd tx checkers create-game $alice $bob 1000000 --from $alice -y
$ checkersd tx checkers play-move 1 1 2 2 3 --from $bob -y
$ checkersd tx checkers play-move 1 0 5 1 4 --from $alice -y
$ checkersd query checkers can-play-move 1 black 2 3 0 5
```

If black tries to capture a red piece on a running game, it returns:

```
possible: true
reason: ok
```

Wait five minutes for the forfeit:

```sh
$ checkersd query checkers can-play-move 1 black 2 3 0 5
```

Now it returns:

```
possible: false
reason: game is already finished
```

</CodeGroupItem>
</CodeGroup>

These queries are all satisfactory.
