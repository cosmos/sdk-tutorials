# Events - Emitting Game Information

<HighlightBox type="synopsis">

Make sure you have everything you need before proceeding:

* You understand the concepts of [events](../2-main-concepts/events.md).
* Have Go installed.
* The checkers blockchain codebase with `MsgPlayMove` and its handling. You can get there by following the [previous steps](./play-game.md) or checking out [the relevant version](https://github.com/cosmos/b9-checkers-academy-draft/tree/play-move-handler).

</HighlightBox>

Now that you have [added the possible actions](./play-game.md) including their return values, use events to alert/notify players.

Imagine a potential or current player waiting for their turn. It is not practical to look at all the transactions and search for the ones signifying the player's turn. It is better to listen to known events that indicate which player's turn it is.

Adding events to your application is as simple as:

1. Defining the events you want to use.
2. Emitting corresponding events as actions unfold.

## Game created event

Start with the event that announces the creation of a new game. The goal is to:

* Inform/alert the players of the game.
* Make it easy for the players to find the relevant game.

So, define some new keys in `x/checkers/types/keys.go`:

```go [https://github.com/cosmos/b9-checkers-academy-draft/blob/f026b947/x/checkers/types/keys.go#L34-L38]
const (
    StoredGameEventKey     = "NewGameCreated" // Indicates what key to listen to
    StoredGameEventCreator = "Creator"
    StoredGameEventIndex   = "Index" // What game is relevant
    StoredGameEventRed     = "Red" // Is it relevant to me?
    StoredGameEventBlack   = "Black" // Is it relevant to me?
)
```

Emit the event in your handler file `x/checkers/keeper/msg_server_create_game.go`:

```go [https://github.com/cosmos/b9-checkers-academy-draft/blob/f026b947/x/checkers/keeper/msg_server_create_game.go#L39-L48]
ctx.EventManager().EmitEvent(
    sdk.NewEvent(sdk.EventTypeMessage,
        sdk.NewAttribute(sdk.AttributeKeyModule, "checkers"),
        sdk.NewAttribute(sdk.AttributeKeyAction, types.StoredGameEventKey),
        sdk.NewAttribute(types.StoredGameEventCreator, msg.Creator),
        sdk.NewAttribute(types.StoredGameEventIndex, newIndex),
        sdk.NewAttribute(types.StoredGameEventRed, msg.Red),
        sdk.NewAttribute(types.StoredGameEventBlack, msg.Black),
    ),
)
```

The only thing left to do is to implement a listener in the GUI or include a server to listen for such events on behalf of the users.

## Player moved event

The created transaction to play a move informs the opponent about:

* Which player is relevant.
* Which game the move relates to.
* When the move happened.
* The move's outcome.
* Whether the game was won.

Contrary to the _create game_ event, which alerted the players about a new game, the players now know which game IDs to keep an eye out for. There is no need to repeat the players' addresses because the game ID is sufficient.

You define new keys in `x/checkers/types/keys.go` similarly:

```go [https://github.com/cosmos/b9-checkers-academy-draft/blob/f026b947/x/checkers/types/keys.go#L41-L48]
const (
    PlayMoveEventKey       = "MovePlayed"
    PlayMoveEventCreator   = "Creator"
    PlayMoveEventIdValue   = "IdValue"
    PlayMoveEventCapturedX = "CapturedX"
    PlayMoveEventCapturedY = "CapturedY"
    PlayMoveEventWinner    = "Winner"
)
```

Emit the event in your file `x/checkers/keeper/msg_server_play_move.go`:

```go [https://github.com/cosmos/b9-checkers-academy-draft/blob/f026b947/x/checkers/keeper/msg_server_play_move.go#L66-L76]
ctx.EventManager().EmitEvent(
     sdk.NewEvent(sdk.EventTypeMessage,
        sdk.NewAttribute(sdk.AttributeKeyModule, "checkers"),
        sdk.NewAttribute(sdk.AttributeKeyAction, types.PlayMoveEventKey),
        sdk.NewAttribute(types.PlayMoveEventCreator, msg.Creator),
        sdk.NewAttribute(types.PlayMoveEventIdValue, msg.IdValue),
        sdk.NewAttribute(types.PlayMoveEventCapturedX, strconv.FormatInt(int64(captured.X), 10)),
        sdk.NewAttribute(types.PlayMoveEventCapturedY, strconv.FormatInt(int64(captured.Y), 10)),
        sdk.NewAttribute(types.PlayMoveEventWinner, game.Winner().Color),
    ),
)
```

## Unit tests

The unit tests you have created so far still pass. However you also want to confirm that the events have been emitted in both situations. The events are recorded in the context, so the test is a little bit different. In `msg_server_create_game_test.go`, add this test:

```go [https://github.com/cosmos/b9-checkers-academy-draft/blob/f026b947/x/checkers/keeper/msg_server_create_game_test.go#L83-L106]
func TestCreate1GameEmitted(t *testing.T) {
    msgSrvr, _, context := setupMsgServerCreateGame(t)
    msgSrvr.CreateGame(context, &types.MsgCreateGame{
        Creator: alice,
        Red:     bob,
        Black:   carol,
    })
    ctx := sdk.UnwrapSDKContext(context)
    require.NotNil(t, ctx)
    events := sdk.StringifyEvents(ctx.EventManager().ABCIEvents())
    require.Len(t, events, 1)
    event := events[0]
    require.EqualValues(t, sdk.StringEvent{
        Type: "message",
        Attributes: []sdk.Attribute{
            {Key: "module", Value: "checkers"},
            {Key: "action", Value: "NewGameCreated"},
            {Key: "Creator", Value: alice},
            {Key: "Index", Value: "1"},
            {Key: "Red", Value: bob},
            {Key: "Black", Value: carol},
        },
    }, event)
}
```

How can you _guess_ the order of elements? Easily, as you created them in this order. Alternatively, you can _peek_ by using Visual Studio Code:

1. Put a breakpoint after `event := events[0]`.
2. Run this test in **debug mode**: right-click the green arrow next to the test name.
3. Observe the live values on the left.

The event emitted during a move may seem unexpected. In a _move_ unit test, two actions occur: a _create_, and a _move_. However, in the setup of this test you do not create blocks but _only_ hit your keeper. Therefore the context collects events but does not flush them. This is why you need to test only for the latter attributes, and verify an array slice that discards events that originate from the _create_ action: `event.Attributes[6:]`. This gives the following test:

```go [https://github.com/cosmos/b9-checkers-academy-draft/blob/f026b947/x/checkers/keeper/msg_server_play_move_test.go#L127-L152]
func TestPlayMoveEmitted(t *testing.T) {
    msgServer, _, context := setupMsgServerWithOneGameForPlayMove(t)
    msgServer.PlayMove(context, &types.MsgPlayMove{
        Creator: carol,
        IdValue: "1",
        FromX:   1,
        FromY:   2,
        ToX:     2,
        ToY:     3,
    })
    ctx := sdk.UnwrapSDKContext(context)
    require.NotNil(t, ctx)
    events := sdk.StringifyEvents(ctx.EventManager().ABCIEvents())
    require.Len(t, events, 1)
    event := events[0]
    require.Equal(t, event.Type, "message")
    require.EqualValues(t, []sdk.Attribute{
        {Key: "module", Value: "checkers"},
        {Key: "action", Value: "MovePlayed"},
        {Key: "Creator", Value: carol},
        {Key: "IdValue", Value: "1"},
        {Key: "CapturedX", Value: "-1"},
        {Key: "CapturedY", Value: "-1"},
        {Key: "Winner", Value: "NO_PLAYER"},
    }, event.Attributes[6:])
}
```
