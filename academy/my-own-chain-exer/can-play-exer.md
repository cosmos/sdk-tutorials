# Exercise - Query - Help Find a Correct Move

Since sending transactions includes costs, how do you assist participants in making sure they at least do not make a wrong move?

## Think

* What structure will facilitate this check?
* Who do you let make such checks?
* What acceptable limitations do you have for this?
* Are there new errors to report back?
* What event should you emit?

## Code

* What Ignite CLI commands, if any, will assist you?
* How do you adjust what Ignite CLI created for you?
* Where do you make your changes?
* How would you unit-test these new elements?
* How would you use Ignite CLI to locally run a one-node blockchain and interact with it via the CLI to see what you get?
