# Exercise - Message and Handler - Add a Way to Make a Move

Your blockchain can now create games, but can you play them? Not yet.. so what do you need to make this possible?

## Think

* What goes into the message?
* How do you sanitize the inputs?
* How do you unequivocally identify games?
* How do you report back errors?
* How do you use your files that implement the Checkers rules?
* How do you make sure that nothing is lost?

## Code

* What Ignite CLI commands will create your message?
* How do you adjust what Ignite CLI created for you?
* How would you unit-test these new elements?
* How would you use Ignite CLI to locally run a one-node blockchain and interact with it via the CLI to see what you get?

As before, do not bother yet with niceties like gas metering or event emission.

When you are satisfied (or not) with what you have, look at [a solution](../3-my-own-chain/play-game.md).
