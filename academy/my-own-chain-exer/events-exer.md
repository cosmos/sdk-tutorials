# Exercise - Events - Emit Game Information

Your blockchain can now create and play games. However, it does not inform the outside world about this in a convenient way. That's where events come in - but what do you need to emit them?

## Think

* Why do actions warrant a detailed event?
* What level of detail goes into each event?
* How do you make it easy for external parties to understand your events?
* At what stage do you emit events?

## Code

* How do you adjust your code to do all this?
* How would you unit-test these new elements?
* How would you use Ignite CLI to locally run a one-node blockchain and interact with it via the CLI to see what you get?

Only focus on the narrow issue of event emission.
