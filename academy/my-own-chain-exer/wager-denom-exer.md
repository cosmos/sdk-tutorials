# Exercise - IBC Token - Play With Cross-Chain Tokens

You could expand the pool of your potential players by extending the pool of possible wager denominations via the use of IBC. How can you do this?

## Think

* What new information do you need?
* How do you sanitize the inputs?
* Are there new errors to report back?
* What event should you emit?

## Code

* What Ignite CLI commands, if any, will assist you?
* How do you adjust what Ignite CLI created for you?
* How would you unit-test these new elements?
* How would you use Ignite CLI to locally run a one-node blockchain and interact with it via the CLI to see what you get?
