Please include all information for the different setups here each under H2 headlines. I will add a general introduction.

# Setting Up Your Work Environment

Prepare a separate project folder where you will keep all your Cosmos exercises.

## Install Go

To develop with the Cosmos SDK you need Go. Head [here](https://go.dev/doc/install) to install it for your system. Picking the latest version of Go will do.

## Install NodeJs

To develop with CosmJS, you need NodeJs. Head [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to install it. The latest version will do.

## Install Visual Studio Code

This integrated development environment will assist you both with developing with the Cosmos SDK and CosmJS. Get it from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).

The first time you open a Cosmos SDK project with it, it will offer to install a Go plug-in. Accept.

## Install Docker

TODO
To do the exercises, you may need to install Docker. Get it from [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

## Install Rust

To work with Rust, you may need to install it first. You can find a well-documented install step-by-step in the [Install page from Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

To check that you are up-to-date run:

```
rustc --version
```

If you already installed the Rust toolchain, you can update your installation by running:

```
rustup update
```

To test the installation of Rust, you can use the following command:

```
cargo version
```

It displays the cargo version helps confirm proper installation.
