# Exercise - Auto-Expiring Games

Players can now reject games, so there is a way for stale games to be removed from storage. But is this enough to avoid _state pollution_?

## Think

* What conditions have to be satisfied for a game to be considered stale and the blockchain to act?
* How do you sanitize the new information inputs?
* How would you get rid of stale games as part of the protocol, that is _without user inputs_?
* How do you optimize performance and data structures so that a few stale games do not cause your blockchain to grind to a halt?
* How can you be sure that your blockchain is safe from attacks?
* How do you make your changes compatible with future plans for wagers?
* Are there errors to report back?
* What event should you emit?

## Code

* What Ignite CLI commands, if any, will assist you?
* How do you adjust what Ignite CLI created for you?
* How would you unit-test these new elements?
* How would you use Ignite CLI to locally run a one-node blockchain and interact with it via the CLI to see what you get?

For now, do not bother yet with future ideas like wager handling.

When you are satisfied (or not) with what you have, look at some solutions which relate to:

* [System performance](../3-my-own-chain/game-fifo.md)
* [Game duration](../3-my-own-chain/game-deadline.md)
* [Good player performance](../3-my-own-chain/game-winner.md)
* [Poor player engagement](../3-my-own-chain/game-forfeit.md)
