# Exercise - Introduce a Leaderboard After Production

If you have been running _v1_ of your checkers blockchain for a while, games have been created, played on, won, and lost. Now you want to increase engagement by adding a leaderboard - how can you do this?

## Think

* What new structures do you need to achieve this goal?
* At what junctures do you update the leaderboard?
* What acceptable limitations do you have for this?
* Are there new errors to report back?
* What event should you emit?
* How do you include the historical games?

## Code

* What Ignite CLI commands, if any, will assist you?
* How do you adjust what Ignite CLI created for you?
* Where do you make your changes?
* How would you unit-test these new elements?
* How would you use Ignite CLI to locally run a one-node blockchain and interact with it via the CLI to see what you get?
