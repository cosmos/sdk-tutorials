<h1 class="mt-4 mb-6">Main Concepts</h1>

Enjoy an introduction to the main components of the Cosmos SDK.

From Tendermint to modules, keepers, queries, and transactions in Cosmos, a whole universe is waiting to be discovered.

Do you have a preferred **learning style**? For instance:

* Do you like to learn about all the concepts before jumping to exercises? If yes, you can start right off with this whole chapter. When you are done, you can jump back to the exercises that you saw mentioned, but skipped, at the bottom of each page.
* Do you like to learn about a single concept and then jump to an exercise that applies what you just learned? If yes, at the bottom of the page of each concept of this chapter, you will find a list of jump-off points where you can experiment.
* Do you like to throw some code at your IDE and commands at your CLI and, only after that, learn about what you did? If yes, for each concept of this chapter, jump to the bottom of the page, where you will find links to exercises, then come back and read about the concept.
* Another way of learning? You get the idea, there is probably a way for you to accommodate it here.
