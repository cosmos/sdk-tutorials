## Think

* What new information do you need?
* How do you sanitize the inputs?
* Are there new errors to report back?
* What event should you emit?

## Code

* What Ignite CLI commands, if any, will assist you?
* How do you adjust what Ignite CLI created for you?
* How would you unit-test these new elements?
* How would you use Ignite CLI to run locally a one-node blockchain and interact with it via the CLI and see what you get?
