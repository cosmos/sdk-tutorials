# A Game Deadline

<HighlightBox type="synopsis">

Make sure you have all you need before proceeding:

* You understand the concepts of [Protobuf](../main-concepts/protobuf.md).
* Have Go installed.
* The checkers blockchain with the game FIFO. Either because you followed the [previous steps](./03-starport-09-game-fifo.md) or because you checked out [its outcome](https://github.com/cosmos/b9-checkers-academy-draft/tree/game-fifo).

</HighlightBox>

In the [previous section](./03-starport-09-game-fifo.md), you introduced a FIFO that keeps the _oldest_ games at its head and the most recently updated games at its tail.

However, just because a game has not been updated in a while, it does not necessarily follow that it has expired. To ascertain this, you need to add a new field, `deadline`, to a game and test against it. Time to prepare the field.

## New information

To prepare the field, add in the `StoredGame`'s Protobuf definition:

```protobuf [https://github.com/cosmos/b9-checkers-academy-draft/blob/0d0e36a8ac86cddc457610856ddaab1b356cee84/proto/checkers/stored_game.proto#L18]
message StoredGame {
    ...
    string deadline = 10;
}
```

To have Starport and Protobuf recompile this file. You can use:

```sh
$ starport generate proto-go
```

How do you manage this field? Well, on each update, the deadline will always be _now_ plus a fixed duration. Remember that the concept of time in blockchain is peculiar. A transaction must be able to be executed in a deterministic fashion on multiple computers, at any time, present or future. So here, _now_ in fact refers to the block's time. Declare this duration as a new constant, along with how the date is to be represented, i.e. encoded, in the saved game, as a string:

```go [https://github.com/cosmos/b9-checkers-academy-draft/blob/0d0e36a8ac86cddc457610856ddaab1b356cee84/x/checkers/types/keys.go#L38-L39]
const (
    MaxTurnDurationInSeconds = time.Duration(24 * 3_600 * 1000_000_000) // 1 day
    DeadlineLayout           = "2006-01-02 15:04:05.999999999 +0000 UTC"
)
```

## Date manipulation

You can make your life easier by using helper functions that encode and decode the deadline in the storage.

1. First, define a new error:

    ```go [https://github.com/cosmos/b9-checkers-academy-draft/blob/0d0e36a8ac86cddc457610856ddaab1b356cee84/x/checkers/types/errors.go#L21]
    ErrInvalidDeadline = sdkerrors.Register(ModuleName, 1110, "deadline cannot be parsed: %s")
    ```

2. So now you can add your date helpers. A reasonable location to pick is `full_game.go`:

    ```go [https://github.com/cosmos/b9-checkers-academy-draft/blob/0d0e36a8ac86cddc457610856ddaab1b356cee84/x/checkers/types/full_game.go#L37-L48]
    func (storedGame *StoredGame) GetDeadlineAsTime() (deadline time.Time, err error) {
        deadline, errDeadline := time.Parse(DeadlineLayout, storedGame.Deadline)
        return deadline, sdkerrors.Wrapf(errDeadline, ErrInvalidDeadline.Error(), storedGame.Deadline)
    }

    func FormatDeadline(deadline time.Time) string {
        return deadline.UTC().Format(DeadlineLayout)
    }
    ```

    Of note in the above is that `sdkerrors.Wrapf(err, ...)` returns `nil` if `err` is `nil`. This is very convenient.

3. While you are at it, add a function that encapsulates the knowledge of how the next deadline is calculated in the same file:

    ```go [https://github.com/cosmos/b9-checkers-academy-draft/blob/0d0e36a8ac86cddc457610856ddaab1b356cee84/x/checkers/types/full_game.go#L42-L44]
    func GetNextDeadline(ctx sdk.Context) time.Time {
        return ctx.BlockTime().Add(MaxTurnDurationInSeconds)
    }
    ```

## Updated deadline

Next you need to update this new field with its appropriate value at the right junctures:

1. At creation, in the message handler for game creation:

    ```go [https://github.com/cosmos/b9-checkers-academy-draft/blob/0d0e36a8ac86cddc457610856ddaab1b356cee84/x/checkers/keeper/msg_server_create_game.go#L26]
    ...
    storedGame := types.StoredGame{
        ...
        Deadline: types.FormatDeadline(types.GetNextDeadline(ctx)),
    }
    ```

2. And after a move, in the message handler:

    ```go [https://github.com/cosmos/b9-checkers-academy-draft/blob/0d0e36a8ac86cddc457610856ddaab1b356cee84/x/checkers/keeper/msg_server_play_move.go#L56]
    ...
    storedGame.MoveCount++
    storedGame.Deadline = types.FormatDeadline(types.GetNextDeadline(ctx))
    ...
    ```

Now confirm that your project still compiles:

```sh
$ starport chain build
```

When it comes to adding and updating a deadline, this is all you need.

You have created and updated the deadline. You have not used it fully yet. That is the object of the [section two steps ahead](./03-starport-12-game-forfeit.md), where you can find a description on how to use the deadline and [the FIFO](./03-starport-09-game-fifo.md) to expire games that reached their deadline.

However, before you can do that, there is one other field you need to add. Discover which in the [next section](03-starport-11-game-winner.md).
