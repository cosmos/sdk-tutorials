# Updating the UI

At this point, we have a functioning blockchain. Now, we can add a UI to upload file hashes from our browser.

First, start by navigating to `localhost:8080`, which hosts our vue applicaton.

## Creating a new Component

In order to make it easier for users to upload a hash to the blockchain, we will create a new component that lets someone drag and drop a file into the UI. The component will calculate the file hash, and the user will have the option to upload this proof as a claim.

We can create a new folder and file called `vue/src/components/DropZone.vue` with following content:

#### `vue/src/components/DropZone.vue`
```vue
<template>
    <div></div>
</template>
<style></style>
```

Import and add our new component `DragZone` into our `vue/src/views/Index.vue` file within `<script></script>` tags:

```vue
import DropZone from "@/components/DropZone";

export default {
  components: { ...sp, DropZone },
};
```

#### `Index.vue`
```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <div class="sp-container">
      <sp-sign-in />
      <sp-bank-balances />
      <sp-token-send />
      <drop-zone />
      <!-- this line is used by starport scaffolding # 4 -->
      <sp-type-form type="claim" :fields="['proof']" />
    </div>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import * as sp from "@tendermint/vue";
import DropZone from "@/components/DropZone";

export default {
  components: { ...sp, DropZone },
};
</script>
```

Now, we should see our UI update whenever we add something to our component.

## Component layout

Next, let's add some elements to create the layout for our component. 

We will be reusing a few components from the `@tendermint/vue` component library, as well as creating our own drop zone.

### `vue/src/components/DropZone.vue`

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <sp-h3>Calculate Proof</sp-h3>
    <div id="drop-zone" @drop.prevent="hash" @dragover.prevent>
      {{ hashed || placeholderText }}
    </div>
    <sp-button
      @click="submit"
      :loading="flight"
      :disabled="hashed == '' || flight"
      >Submit Proof as a new Claim</sp-button
    >
  </div>
</template>

<style scoped>
#drop-zone {
  font-family: "Inter", "Helvetica", sans-serif;
  height: 20rem;
  line-height: 20rem;
  font-size: 1.25rem;
  background-color: rgb(247, 247, 247);
  text-align: center;
  margin-bottom: 2rem;
  border-radius: 0.5rem;
}
</style>
```

Back to `vue/src/views/Index.vue`, add the following JavaScript code right after previous section added in `<script></script>` tags:

```js
import { SpH3, SpButton } from "@tendermint/vue";

export default {
  components: {
    SpH3,
    SpButton,
  },
  data() {
    return {
      placeholderText: "Drag and drop a file here",
      hashed: "",
      flight: false,
    };
  },
  methods: {
    hash(e) {},
    async submit() {},
  }
}
```


## Implementing our hash functionality

As mentioned earlier, we want to be able to upload a file to the browser, calculate its hash, and submitting our hash to the blockchain.

First, we will add the `js-sha256` package. Let's install it via `npm`, and **make sure we're in the** `vue/` **directory when we run the following command**.

```sh
npm install --save js-sha256
```

Once installed, we can add the `import` and `hash(e){}` functionality for creating the hash:

```js
import { sha256 } from "js-sha256";

...
  methods: {
    hash(e) {
      const files = e.dataTransfer.items;
      if (!files.length) return;
      // Read the file and hash it
      const reader = new FileReader();
      reader.onload = (ev) => {
        this.hashed = sha256(ev.target.result);
      };
      reader.readAsArrayBuffer(files[0].getAsFile());
    },
```

And now we can add our `submit(){}` function, which will dispatch actions to the `cosmos` store for submitting and fetching things from our blockchain.

```js
    async submit() {
      // Submit
      this.flight = true;
      await this.$store.dispatch("cosmos/entitySubmit", {
        type: "claim",
        body: {
          proof: this.hashed,
        },
      });
      await this.$store.dispatch("cosmos/entityFetch", {
        type: "claim",
      });

      // Clear fields
      this.flight = false;
      this.hashed = "";
    },
```

Voilà! We can now log in using the mnemonic provided when running the `starport chain serve` command, and start uploading proof of files as claims to the blockchain!

Congratulations, your app is complete!
