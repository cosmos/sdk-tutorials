# pofe

**pofe** (Proof ) is a blockchain application built using Cosmos SDK and Tendermint and generated with [Starport](https://github.com/tendermint/starport).

A Proof of File Existence can help prove the authenticity of a certain file at a particular timestamp. This is done by calculating the hash of any given file (the proof), and uploading the hash to the blockchain (timestamping).


## Get started

```
starport serve
```

`serve` command installs dependencies, initializes and runs the application.

## Configure

Initialization parameters of your app are stored in `config.yml`.

### `accounts`

A list of user accounts created during genesis of your application.
