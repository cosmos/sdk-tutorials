# The Cosmos Hub Testnet

The [Cosmos Network](https://cosmos.network) is an expanding ecosystem of connected blockchains. Many blockchains in the ecosystem are built with [Tendermint Core](https://docs.tendermint.com/) and [Cosmos SDK](https://docs.cosmos.network/). These blockchains are connected with  the Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol [(IBC)](https://ibcprotocol.org/). 

One of these blockchains is the [Cosmos Hub](https://cosmos.network/features). Mainnet of the Cosmos Hub has been online since early 2019. You can learn how to join the network as a validator, see [Run a Validator on the Cosmos Hub Mainnet](https://hub.cosmos.network/main/validators/validator-setup.html).

## What is a testnet?

A testnet is a network launched for developers and validators to test the functionality of the blockchain before the main network is launched. The state of a testnet can be reset at any time.

Now that you know what a testnet is, it's time to get started. See [About the Testnet Tutorial](testnet-tutorial.md).
